**5.1 Dimensional Analysis Interpretations** (ref 5.2)

 

Aerodynamic force = *F*

 

• *F = f* *(ρ, μ, T*, *V*, shape, orientation, size, roughness, gravity)

• For aircraft ignore *R*, *K* & hypersonic effects

  

![][1]• Initially assume similar body orientations, shapes & roughness.

 

• Dimensional Analysis reveals four non-dimensional (π) parameters:

 

  Force Coefficient

 ![][2]![][3] Reynolds Number

  Mach Number

  Froude Number

 

A closer look at the force coefficient:

 

![][4]

 where ^1^/~2~ ρ*~a~V~T~*^2^ = ^1^/~2~ ρ*~o~V~e~*^2^ =dynamic pressure, *q* dimensions of reference wing area, *S* are the same as *l*^2^

 

 **A feel for *q***

• Kinetic energy of a moving object = ½ mV~T~^2^

• Block of moving air kinetic energy = ½ ρ (volume) V ~T~^2^

• Dividing through by volume yields KE per volume of moving air = ½ ρ V ~T~^2^

• \"Dynamic pressure" or "*q*" = potential for converting each cubic foot of the airflow\'s kinetic energy into frontal stagnation pressure

• Feel *q* by extending your hand out the window of a moving car

 

 **A feel for coefficients**

• *C ~F~* = (*F /S)/q* = the ratio between the total force pressure and the flow \'s dynamic pressure

• Lift is the component of the total force perpendicular to the free stream flow

• Drag is the component along the flow

• Break total into lift and drag coefficients:

*C ~L~ = (L/S)/q CD = (D/S)/q*

• Increasing dynamic pressure generates a larger total force, lift and drag

 

 ![][5]

• Froude number is not significant in aerodynamic phenomena

 

• Recall that forces are aslo a function of angle of attack, shape & surface roughness, therefore

 

![][6]

Effects are exaggerated

 

![][7]

To compare test day and standard day aircraft or to match wind tunnel *C~F~* data to actual aircraft; the shape, roughness, *M, R~n~* and *α* must be equal for both aircraft

 

![][8]![][9]

 

**5.2 General Aerodynamic Relations** (refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

** **

Lift & Drag forces can be described using two approaches:

1\) Change in momentum of airstream, *F = d{mv\]/dt*

2\) "Bernoulli" approach which requires the continuity and conservation of energy equations

 

**Continuity Equation**

Fluid M ass in = Fluid Mass out

ρ ~1~*V* ~1~*A* ~1~ = ρ ~2~*V* ~2~*A* ~2~

For subsonic (incompressible) flow ρ ~1~ = ρ ~2~

> *V* ~1~*A* ~1~ = *V* ~2~*A* ~2~
>
> ~ ~

**Conservation of Energy** (Bernoulli) **Equation:**

Potential + Kinetic + Pressure = constant

(changes in Potential energy are negligible)

Energy per unit volume is pressure then

Dynamic Pressure + Static Pressure = Total Pressure

![][10] 

 

• This classic approach only applies in the "potential flow" region and not in the boundary layer where energy losses occur

 

• Pressures around a surface can be calculated or measured from tests and converted into pressure coefficients,

 

*c~p~* = (*p*~local~-*p*~ambient~)/dynamic pressure = *∆p/q*

 

• *c~p~* values can be mapped out for all surfaces

 

 

 ![][11]

 • Summation of all pressures perpendicular to surface yield the pitching moments and the "**Resultant Aerodynamic Force**" which is broken into lift and drag components

 

![][12]

 

 • Lift & drag forces are referred to the aerodynamic center (*ac*) where the pitching moment is constant for reasonable angles of attack.

• Pitching moments increase with airfoil camber, are zero if symmetric.

• Aerodynamic center is located at 25% MAC for fully subsonic flow and at 50% MAC for fully supersonic flow.

 

**5.3 Wing Design Effects on Lift Curve Slope** (refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

 

**Aspect Ratio Effect**

• Pressure differential at wingtip causes tip vortex

 

![][13]

 

 ![][14] 

• Vortex creates flow field that reduces AOA across wingspan

 

![][15]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 • Local AOA reductions decrease average lift curve slope

![][16] 

2D wing = wind tunnel

airfoil extending to walls (infinite aspect ratio).

 

*a~o~* = Lift curve slope for

an infinite wing

 

*a* = Lift curve slope for

a finite wing

Inserting air values (*T~K~*=Kelvin and T*~R~*=Rankin) into Sutherland law gives

 **Reynolds Number Effects** (ref 5.10)

 

• Laminar boundary layers have more gradual change in

velocity near surface than

turbulent boundary layers.

• High Reynolds numbers help

![][31] propagate turbulent flow.

 

 

![][32]

![][33]

*Re~L~* based on total length of flat plate

 

• Depth of boundary layer (δ) depends on local Reynolds number (Re~x~) and whether the flow is turbulent or laminar.

 

![][34]

![][35]*x*= distance traveled to point in question

 

**5.4.2 Pressure Drag**

** **

• Ideal frictionless flow has no losses and leads to zero pressure drag

 

• Real fluids have friction and energy losses along surface

 

• Energy losses negate total pressure recovery, lead to decreasing total pressure along surface

 

![][36]

• Imbalance of pressures on surfaces causes pressure drag

![][37]![][38] 

• Profile streamlining reduces pressure drag

![][39] 

**5.4.3 Interference Drag**

 

• Occurs with multiple surfaces approximately parallel to flow

 

• Caused by flow's interference with itself or by excessive adverse pressure gradient due to rapidly decreasing vehicle cross section

 

• Most severe with surfaces at acute angles to each other

 

• Effects often reduced by fillets around contracting surfaces

 

![][40]

**5.4.4 Induced Drag**

** **

• Wingtip vortex reduces local AOA at each station along wing

 

• Local lift vector is perpendicular to local AOA

 

• Local lift vector is therefore tilted back relative to freestream lift

 

• Induced drag defined as rearward component of local lift vector

![][41] 

![][42]

Oswald efficiency factor, *e*, accounts for losses in excess of those predicted above (due to uneven downwash and changing interference drag effects).

**Total vs Ambient Property Relations for Adiabatic Flow**

![][45] 

**Normal Shock Relations**

Assumes flow across shock is adiabatic

Property changes occur in a constant area (throat)

Normal shock summary

 

![][47]

**5.5.1 Oblique Shocks**

 

**Oblique Shock Description**

![][48] 

δ = surface turning angle

 

θ = shock wave angle

 

Subscript 1 denotes upstream conditions

 

Subscript 2 denotes downstream conditions

 

**Oblique Shock Relations**

• Calculate *P~2~/P~1~, T~2~/T~1~*, and *ρ~2~/ρ~1~* across oblique shocks by using normal shock equations and substituting *M~1~ sinθ* in place of *M~1~*

• Calculate total pressure loss across oblique shock as

• Calculate relation between Mach number and angles as

 

![][49]![][50]

**Oblique Shock Turning Angle as a Function of Wave Angle**

 

![][51]

• Two θ solutions exist for every M~1~ & *δ* combination

These represent the strong and weak shock solutions

Weak shocks normally occur in nature

• There is a minimum Mach number for each turning angle

• The wave angle of a weak shock decreases with increased Mach

• For a given Mach number, *θ* approaches *μ* as *δ* decreases

 

 

**Mach Cone Angle**

 

 

![][52]

Minimum Wave Angle

μ = sin^−1 ^(1/Μ)

 

**5.5.2 Supersonic Isentropic Expansion Relations**

 

![][53]

• The wave angle *μ* determines where the lower pressure can be felt and thus where the flow can be accelerated

• As the flow accelerates, a new wave angle forms and the subsequent lower pressure further accelerates the flow

• Results in a series of Mach waves forming a "fan" until the flow turns and accelerates so that it is parallel to the new boundary

 

**Prandtl-Meyer Function**

Shows flow's required turning angle (ν) to accelerate from one Mach number to another

 

![][54]

• If upstream Mach (M~1~) =1, then ν~1~ = 0, and equation directly relates downstream Mach (M~2~) to surface turning angle (∆ν)

• If M~1~\>1, determine M~2~ as follows:

Calculate upstream ν~1~ from above equation

Calculate ν~2~ = ν~1~ + ∆ν

Reverse above equation to obtain corresponding M~2~

• Above equation is tabulated in NACA TR 1135 and is plotted below

![][55] 

Example: Flow initially at *M~1~* = 2.0 accelerates through an expansion corner of 24 *deg*. Exit Mach number is 3.0

 

**5.5.3 Two-Dimensional Supersonic Airfoil Approximations**

 

• Determine surface static pressures by calculating changes through obliques shocks and expansion fans

 ![][73]

 

 **Propeller Slipstream Effects**

•  a.k.a "scrubbing" drag

•  Propwash increases flow speed over surface within slipstream

•  More drag is created by higher *q* and vorticity.

•  Function of prop speed and power absorbed (*C~p~*)or thrust (*C~T~*)

• Problem should be addressed in airframe or propeller models
