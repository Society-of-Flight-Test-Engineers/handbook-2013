**Section 2.4 Matrix Algebra**

(reference 2.5)

Matrix **multiplication** can be defined for any two matrices only whe the number of columns of the first is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix. Multiplication is not defined for other matrices.

\[*A*\]\[*B*\] = \[*C*\]

\[*a~im~*\]\[*b~mj~*\] = \[*c~ij~*\]

The product of a pair of, 2 × 2 matrices is:

![][25]

The **identity** (or [unit]{.underline}) matrix \[*I*\] occupies the same position in matrix algebra that the value of unity does in ordinary algebra. That is, for any matrix

[]{.underline}![][26]

\[*A*\]: \[*I*\]\[*A*\] = \[*A*\]\[*I*\] = \[*A*\]

The identity \[*I*\] is a square matrix consisting of ones on the principle diagonal and zeros everywhere else; i.e.:

*a* ⋅ *α*^−1^ = *α*^1−1^ = *α*^0^ = 1

In the same way, the matrix \[*A*\]^-1^ is called the inverse matrix of \[*A*\] since:

\[*A*\]\[*A*\]^-1^ = \[*A*\]^-1^\[*A*\] = \[*A*\]^0^ = \[*I*\]

Cofactors and Determinates
==========================

![][27]
=======

The signed minor, with the sign determined by the sum of the row and column, is called the **cofactor** of *a~ij~* and is denoted by:

*A~ij~* = (−1)*^i+j^ Μ~ij~*

The value of the **determinant** is equal to the sum of the products of the

elements of any single row or column and their respective cofactors.

Arbitrarily expanding about the first row of a 3 x 3 matrix gives the

determinant:

\|*A*\| = *a~11~A~11~ + a~12~A~12~ + a~13~A~13~ =*

![][28]

which expands to give the final solution:

\|*A*\| = *a*~11~(*a*~22~ *a*~33~ − *a*~23~ *a*~32~) − *a*~12~(*a*~21~ *a*~33~ − *a*~23~ *a*~31~) + *a*~13~(*a*~21~ *a*~32~ − *a*~22~ *a*~31~) 

There is a straightforward four-step method for computing the **inverse** of a

given matrix \[*A*\]:

**Step 1** Compute the determinant of \[*A*\]. This determinant is written \|*A*\|. If the determinant is zero or does not exist, the matrix \[*A*\] is defined as singular and an inverse cannot be found.

**Step 2** Transpose matrix \[*A*\]. The resultant matrix is written \[*A*\]*^T^*.

**Step 3** Replace each element a~ij~ of the transposed matrix by its cofactor *A~ij~*. This resulting matrix is defined as the adjoint of matrix \[*A*\] and is written Adj\[*A*\].

**Step 4** Divide the adjoint matrix by the scalar value of the determinant of \[*A*\] which was computed in Step 1. The resulting matrix is the inverse and is written \[*A*\]^-1^.

*Example:* Given the following set of simultaneous equations, solve for

*x*~1~, *x*~2~, and *x*~3~.

3*x*~1~ *+* 2*x*~2~ *− * 2*x*~3~* * = *y*~1~

*− x*~1~ *+ x*~2~   +* * 4*x*~3~* * = *y*~2~

2*x*~1~ * −* 3*x*~2~ +* * 4*x*~3~* * = *y*~3~

This set of equations can be written as: \[*A*\]^ ^ \[*x*\] = \[*y*\]

![][29]

and solved as follows: \[*x*\] = \[*A*\]^−1^ \[*y*\]

Thus, the system can be solved for the values of *x*~1~, *x*~2~, and *x*~3~ by computing the inverse of \[*A*\].

**Step 1.** Compute the determinant of \[*A*\]. Expanding about the first row

\|*A*\| *=* 3(4 + 12) − 2 (−4 −8) −2 (3 − 2)

\|*A*\| *=* 48 + 24 −2 = 70

**Step 2.** Transpose \[*A*\].

![][30]

**Step 3.** Determine the adjoint matrix by replacing each element in \[*A*\]*^T^* by its Cofactor.

![][31]

**Step 4.** Divide by the scalar value of the determinant of \[*A*\] which was computed as 70 in Step 1.

**Cramer's Rule**

Given matrices A{x} = {b}

If the det (D) of a matrix (A) exists, and D~r~ is the det of the matrix obtained from A by replacing the rth column of A by the column {b}, then the solution to (1) is x~r~ = D~r~/D r = 1,2,...,n

The first derivative of a position vector is a vector tangential to the trajectory with a magnitude equal to the speed of the particle.

**Motion of a point using two reference systems**.

Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while Rotation of the B reference relative to the A reference must be considered when observing motion wrt the A reference system.

![][51]

Note: Unit vectors are along the B system axes. Subscripts denote reference system. Reference B can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft.

![][52]

![][53]

The velocities of the particle *P* relative to the *A* and to the *B* references are, respectively:

![][54]

These velocities can be related by noting that:

**Discrete Probability Distributions:**

**Binomial:** N independent events, each having probability *p* of success, and1-*p* of failure. For example, tossing a fair coin N times where *p =* the probability of getting a head on any toss. If the random variable x indicates the number of heads in N=2 tosses, then P(x=0) = 1/4, P(x=1) = 1/2, P(x=2) = 1/4. If N=4, then the probabilities are illus trated in the following graph:

![][71]

As N approaches infinity \...

 

![][72]

So**,** the binomial distribution is the discrete case of the Normal distribution.

 

**Continuous Distributions:** As the number of samples increases and the width of the Discrete sample intervals shrink to zero, discrete distributions become continuous.

 

P(x=X) = 0

**Determining Sample Size:** For the population mean to fall into an interval defined by

Where is the accuracy desired (or the error that can be tolerated).

 

Since the sample size decision must be made prior to the test, an estimate must be made for the population standard deviation. Using the estimate we can solve for N

![][88] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Hypothesis Testing:** Begins with an assumption (hypothesis), usually about the underlying population distribution of some measured quantity or computed error. Select values for the hypothesis and alternate hypothesis(es) that partition the sample space. Collect N samples of the population test statistic or parameter. There are two types of errors: Type 1 errors reject the hypothesis when it is true; Type II accept the hypothesis when in is false.
