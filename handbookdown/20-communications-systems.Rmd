# Communication Systems Testing

Written by Jim Fawcett <james.fawcett@airbus.com>

The below content is relative to CS25/Part 25 radio communications equipment 
testing, principally on large civil aircraft.

## VHF Radios

### Technology

Aeronautical very high frequency (VHF) radios are a line-of sight (LOS) 
technology within the frequency band 118.000-136.975 megahertz MHz
and channel separations of 8.33 (historically 25) MHz. The 
typical output power on commercial aircraft is in the order of 25 watts W 
in AM (amplitude modulation) mode. Typically mounted on the fuselage-mounted, 
blade antennae best serve the wavelengths within the frequency band. Less common 
mounting locations include wing tips or the vertical tailplane.

Modern VHF radios include capacity for datalink communications within the same 
frequency band. Such radios are referred to as VDR (VHF Data Radio) or MVDR 
(Multiple VDR). V identifies mono-channel equipment with one avionics box per 
radio channel, whereas M identifies multi-channel equipment where one avionics 
box controls two radio channels.

Data communications currently employ one of two "modes". Mode 2 (for ATN -- 
Aircraft Telecommunications Network) has recently replaced mode A (Aircraft 
Communications Addressing and Reporting System - ACARS) due to higher throughput 
rates. Mode A remains deployed in some areas of the world.

To satisfy CS25/Part 25 certification requirements, a typical civil aircraft 
will have 3 VHF or VDR or 2 MVDR with 2 channels each, providing 
three VDR channels and one hot spare.

### Test Objectives

The four principle objectives for voice functions are range, masking, control, 
and interference. When relevant, functional tests of data applications and 
switching between voice and data services should also be assessed.

**Range performance**

The theoretical maximum line of sight distance for a VHF radio with one station 
on an aircraft and one station on the ground at sea-level on a flat surface is

|||
|-:|:-|
| ![][20001] | \[\text{range} \left[ \text{NM} \right] \sim\ 1.06\sqrt{h \left[ \text{ft} \right]}\] |

Atmospheric refraction deflects electromagnetic waves and VHF signals may travel 
beyond line-of-sight by an amount varying slightly according to atmospheric 
conditions. A common memorable empirically-based relation is

|||
|-:|:-|
| ![][20002] | \[\text{range} \left[ \text{NM} \right] = 1.23\sqrt{h \left[ \text{ft} \right]}\] |

Transmission distance can increase if the ground station is above sea-level, or 
reduce if there is terrain between the aircraft and the ground station.

![][20003]

The minimum range performance to be demonstrated is 80% of the so-called 
"optical" (LOS) range, adjusted for altitude. Test at or above FL310.

**Masking performance**

As VHF is a LOS technology, any obstacle between the aircraft and the ground 
station can partially or totally attenuate signal strength. Such an obstacle 
may be on the ground (see comments on terrain in the section on range 
performance) but may also be any major aircraft structural element such as the 
fuselage, wings, tailplane, engines, or landing gear.

![][20004]

Perform masking checks at 65% of the optical range, adjusted for altitude, Test 
at or above FL310.

**Audio and control integration**

It is highly unusual for modern civil transport aircraft to operate VHF on a 
stand-alone basis. Typically, audio management system centralizes the audio 
which is available to all crew members through a variety of listening equipment 
(boomset, headset, loudspeaker). The crew controls radios via a management 
interface which may be a dedicated Radio Management Panel (RMP) or included in 
a display format. For new installations testing to include tuning from all 
combinations of radios and panels is needed.

Testers must verify the radios can be controlled correctly and the audio 
quality is correct. In the absence of a universally accepted and easily 
implemented objective solution for audio volume and clarity, the flight crew 
may use a subjective scale to judge for loudness and clearness. This will 
include a signal report on the transmission from the ground station as well.

**Non-interference**

By their nature as electromagnetic transmission systems, VHF radios can be an 
interference victim or source. This can take two forms: interaction between 
different VHF radios operating on similar frequencies, or interaction between 
the VHF system and other aircraft systems or interactions from other systems to 
the VHF system.

Concerning the first interaction, the relative proximity of aircraft VHF 
antennas make it difficult to avoid interference for frequency separations of 
less than 6 MHz. This can be easily identified for voice communications 
(interference on VHF radio X frequency A reception when VHF radio Y is emitting 
on frequency B) but can be more difficult to identify for data communications 
when the frequency used for data transmissions is not readily visible in the 
cockpit.

For interactions between VHF radios and different aircraft systems, the issue 
only occurs during VHF transmission by the aircraft due to the radiated power 
from the VHF antennae located close to other systems. Electromagnetic 
interference studies can predict the frequencies (or their harmonics) which may 
be problematic.

For new installations, interactions from the aircraft systems to the VHF
receivers, an EMI ground test is needed to determine what, if any, interference
is entering the receiver's circuitry, either through the antenna or through
wiring that will show up as a noise on a particular frequency. A spectrum
analyser connected to the aircraft's antennas, performing a scan throughout the
entire VHF comm/nav band is needed to find any narrow band emissions from other
systems that may be interfering. Checks at low, medium and high frequencies is
no longer acceptable as most interference is now from narrow band emissions.
For further details and recommendations, consult RTCA DO-160.

### Test technique

**Range performance**

The aircraft flies outbound ≥ FL310 on any convenient radial from a calibrated
ground station. The aircraft distance from the ground station is needed and
most often determined via FMS or GPS. VOR/DME data, when the ground station is
located close to VOR/DME equipment, can be used, but since VOR/DME is also a
line-of-sight technology and the output power can be lower than for a VHF
transmitter, it is likely that the VOR/DME range will be lost before voice
communication is interrupted.

Every 5 NM (or more often, if required), a flight crew member calls a ground
crew member who notes the transmission loudness/clarity. They then swap roles
to determine aircraft reception. The checks continue until the loudness or
clearness drops below 3, at which point the maximum range is considered to have
been reached. It can nevertheless be useful to continue flying and testing
outbound to characterise the distance at which there is a total loss of
communication.

A few nautical miles after completing outbound communication testing, the
aircraft should reverse course to fly inbound on any convenient radial from the
calibrated ground station. Once again, calls should continue every 5 NM until
the communication is re-established with a loudness/clearness of at least 3.
Repeat the above check for each radio and antenna combination.

Depending on the antenna position, some masking may occur (e.g. tailplane masks
a forward upper fuselage-mounted antenna during outbound legs). Results can
demonstrate masking performance, or conversely justify any discrepancy in range
obtained for outbound and inbound legs.

**Masking performance**

Longitudinal masking from the fuselage and/or tailplane having been identified
during the range checks, only fuselage masking remains to be verified.

The aircraft flies a 360° turn to the left or to the right, centered at 65% of
the optical range, adjusted for altitude, the test being performed ≥ FL310. To
identify areas where there is a reduction in signal strength, verify
transmission and reception loudness & clearness every 30° of heading.
Demonstrate that reductions in strength are justified when considering the
antenna location relative to the fuselage and taking into account the relative
positions of the aircraft and the ground station. Repeat the check for each
radio and antenna combination.

On occasion, checks may be performed with landing gear and/or flaps/slats
extended. However, since such configurations usually correspond to landing
configurations, the distance between the aircraft and the ground station is
reduced and the radiated power is therefore usually sufficient for the signal
to "get around" the masking element. In case of unusual antenna locations
and/or aircraft configurations, additional masking checks may be required.

**Audio and control integration**

General use of VHF radios during the course of standard flight operations is
usually enough to identify if there is an issue of audio and/or control
integration. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure all available radios are
controlled from all available RMPs and the audio performance is checked from
all available crew member positions with all available communications means
(boomset, headset, hand microphone/loudspeaker, oxygen mask, etc). Typically,
comfortable audio levels should be confirmed at mid-range volume setting on any
audio control device.

**Non-interference**

**VHF / VHF**

When listening on VHF radio X, transmit VHF radio Y frequencies previously
agreed with the design office. Generally, do this at decreasing frequency
spacings or on harmonic frequencies to assess the absence of interference, or
acceptability level if interference occurs. Verify each combination of VHF and
antenna. Such a test could be performed on the ground, but there is a strong
potential for additional interference caused by signal reflections from
surrounding infrastructure (buildings, ground, other aircraft or vehicles,
etc.)

**VHF / other aircraft systems**

Evaluate the effect of each VHF radio transmission on other aircraft systems by
transmitting on VHF frequencies previously agreed with the design office
(almost always corresponding to harmonic frequencies for different aircraft
systems).

Note that electromagnetic interference is not limited to systems with similar
operating characteristics (e.g. radio navigation equipment). It may also
concern other aircraft systems, particularly those with long and potentially
not well-shielded wiring runs.

### Weather conditions

VHF communications are not significantly affected by atmospheric conditions
such as clouds or precipitation, wind or temperature. Therefore, there is no
significant restriction when testing VHF radios - especially since it is often
done at altitude in rather clear air. The only exception would be interference
due to lightning when discharging in proximity.

### Safety

VHF use for ATC purposes is part of standard operating procedures for air crews
and is not considered an inherently risky test. Nevertheless, due to the
multiple changes of frequency and radio under test, combined with the fact that
often a test frequency rather than an ATC frequency is used, there is potential
for losing the current ATC frequency. This can be compounded on aircraft types
where the standby frequency is not synchronised between RMPs. Clear
communication between the crew members about who is tuning which radio and
using which RMP can mitigate any problems.

Ensure appropriate authorisations are in place for planned test frequencies. If
an ATC frequency is used for some reason, avoid working heavily-used locations.
Do not perform blind transmissions on a frequency without first listening for a
while to see if that frequency is being used by other traffic.

### Tips and hints

A common comment about audio quality is that "there is an echo." This is
usually due to more than one radio being tuned to the same frequency, thus both
are heard simultaneously. It is therefore good practice to listen to only one
radio at a time and ensure all radios are tuned to different frequencies.

VHF data frequencies range from 131 to 136 MHz. Therefore, in case of
interference on voice frequencies above 125 MHz (i.e. below the 6 MHz
separation limit), consider switching off the VHF data mode to see if this is
the source of the interference.

Different radio types have different characteristics. Some may demonstrate a
gradual loss of signal strength whereas others may have a more abrupt
transition from intelligible to unintelligible. This is another reason to
continue range checks beyond the loudness/clearness level 3.

The number of available VHF frequencies, even with 8.33 MHz spacing, is rather
limited and the same frequencies are re-used at multiple ground stations. An
aircraft at high altitude may be able to receive more than one ground station
transmitting at the same frequency. Accordingly, ensure the right ground
station is answering!

## HF radios

### Technology

The significant benefit of high frequency (HF) technology is the ability to
communicate beyond line of sight. This is possible because the HF wavelengths
(2-30 MHz with 1 kHz channel spacing) are such that the signal can easily
reflect off the Earth's surface or different ionosphere layers (layers of
charged particles at altitudes between 60 and 1000 km). While LOS
communications are possible, coverage is not entirely guaranteed between the
aircraft and all ground stations because there may be "holes" where reflected
signals do not reach the ground.

![][20005]

The long wavelengths involved would generally dictate the use of very long
antennas. On an aircraft, this is not always geometrically possible. Cable
antennas from the upper forward fuselage to the forward tip of the fin are one
solution; so-called towel-bar antennas stood off from the fuselage are another
option. However, more common, since the aerodynamic impact is much lower, is to
fit the antenna inside the leading edge of one of the surfaces, typically the
fin.

Nevertheless, such antennas must be tuned to optimize their performance. This
is achieved by connecting a coupler to the antenna. The coupler in turn is
connected to the transceiver via a network of coaxial cables. Aeronautical
transceivers generally provide both voice and data communications and can use
upper side band (USB) or amplitude modulations (AM). A typical system output
power is 400 W.

CS25/Part 25 do not require multiple HF radios. Operational requirements for
remote or oceanic airspace will nevertheless almost always require two
independent long-range communication systems. Even if only one single antenna
is usually installed, two separate transceiver/coupler chains are needed to
fulfill the independence criteria.

### Test Objectives

HF testing has several objectives. In addition to the below items, functional
tests of data applications and switching between voice and data services may be
assessed if relevant.

**Range performance**

There is no hard and fast numerical value for HF range performance, even if in
practice, over the horizon contacts at 700nm+ is considered adequate.
Nevertheless, it should be generally possible to achieve distances of 1000 NM
or more, depending on the time of day and the frequency being used. A good
guide is to consider operational requirements on routes on which HF radio may
be used; there are very few points in the world's oceanic or polar regions that
lie on commonly operated routes which are more than 1000 NM from land and
therefore from an HF transmitter (indeed, so-called "point Nemo", the most
remote oceanic point on the planet, is only 1500 NM from any land). The check
should be performed in the clean configuration at a representative cruise
altitude.

It is also desirable to perform a short-range communication, preferable at low
altitude, to check for any issues linked to saturation when receiving signal
from the ground station at relatively high power.

**Masking performance**

Masking performance is generally not an issue for HF radios, because signal
reflections can allow for non-LOS communications.

**Audio and control integration**

The same comments as for VHF testing apply for HF testing.

**Non-interference**

The principal problem with HF radios is the relatively high radiated power.
Accordingly, even systems not operating on nearby frequencies (actual or
harmonic) may be affected by aircraft HF radio transmissions. Aircraft with one
HF antenna shared between two transceivers avoiding HF/HF interference, but
those with dual HF antennas (principally military or search and rescue/maritime
patrol operations) might. On such aircraft, there is often an interlock to
prevent simultaneous transmission from both antennas at the same time.

### Atmospheric conditions

Beyond LOS communications for HF rely on reflections of the transmission
between layers of the ionosphere and the Earth's surface. The exact position
(altitude) of the ionosphere layers is a function of the time of day, the time
of year, and solar activity. While the effect of the time of day and time of
year on HF range performance is rather easy to predict, solar activity can only
be precisely detailed a few minutes in advance. Satellites located between the
Earth and the Sun measure the solar wind and transmit characteristics to Earth.
Nevertheless, as solar activity is rather cyclic in nature, some high-level
predictions can be made. The reflectivity of the Earth's surface is also
variable according to the type of surface (water, land, vegetation, etc.) and
the local weather conditions. It is therefore possible to generate coverage (or
"propagation") maps for any given frequency, aircraft position, and time of
day. For general purpose HF testing, it should be possible to achieve
reasonable results almost any time, but if a specific range performance is
targeted or if only a short time window is available for testing, such coverage
maps can be a useful tool for optimizing testing.

In case of intense solar activity, it is possible for HF communications to be
completely unavailable (so-called "blackout"). Such periods of activity also
generate strong auroras and may also impact terrestrial or satellite
communications.

![][20006]

### Test technique

**Range performance**

With the aircraft established at a cruise flight level in clean configuration,
calls should be made to close and distant ground stations on a range of
frequencies, using both USB and AM modulations. Note the distance from the
station and loudness/clearness for transmission (i.e., as heard at the ground
station) and reception (i.e., as heard on the aircraft). The system is
considered successful if the loudness and clearness have a minimum level of 3.
The check should be repeated at low altitude and short distance from a ground
station.

**Masking performance**

It is unusual to perform specific masking checks for HF radios.

**Audio and control integration**

The same comments as for VHF testing apply for HF testing.

**Non-interference**

The same comments as for VHF testing apply for HF testing. Bear in mind the
increased transmission power of HF radios.

### Safety

Because the output power of HF radios is considerably higher than other
communication means, it is generally recommended to not transmit HF from the
aircraft if there are maintenance personnel nearby or if refueling is in
progress. Ensure the appropriate authorisations are in place for the planned
test frequencies. If an ATC frequency is used for some reason, avoid working
heavily-used locations. Do not perform blind transmissions on a frequency
without first listening for a while to see if that frequency is being used by
other traffic.

### Tips and hints

HF communications can be heard by numerous aircraft over a wide area.
Furthermore, for long-range tests it is common to use commercially available
providers (such as Stockholm radio) or even distant ATC centers (Gander or New
York for tests in European airspace, for example). Such frequencies are widely
used and therefore it is important to use standardized phraseology when
performing HF checks on "public" frequencies. Communications should be short,
efficient, and spoken clearly, since even on a good day, HF communications are
not of a very high quality.

A rule of thumb for finding a good frequency for long-range communications is
to consider the position of the sun over the horizon. If it is low in the sky
(or at night), testers prefer a low frequency. If it is high in the sky, a high
frequency will generally be more successful.

To facilitate operations, and bearing in mind that some parts of the planet are
in darkness and others in daylight, the same frequencies are re-used at
multiple ground stations. An aircraft performing very long range communications
may therefore be in contact with more than one ground station using the same
frequency. Therefore, ensure the right ground station is answering! This is a
common occurrence in the North Atlantic where in the track system, the
frequencies in use move from one side of the ocean to the other according to
the time of day and the predominant traffic flows.

On aircraft equipped with flight test instrumentation, aircraft HF
transmissions can generate spurious readings on strain gauges located near the
antenna. HF testing should therefore be avoided on flights where data from the
strain gauges could be critical (e.g. loads monitoring).

## SATCOM

This section covers only cockpit-based SATCOM communications systems. It does
not address the testing of cabin-based SATCOM communications systems, typically
in the Ka or Ku bands, which are usually used for the transmission of large
amounts of data at rather high speeds, such as passenger internet access/mobile
telephony, or military intelligence applications.

### Technology

There are two principal satellite communication systems in use on large civil
aircraft.

**INMARSAT**

Inmarsat satellites, initially designed with maritime operations in mind, are
geostationary satellites orbiting 36000 km above the equator. Different
generations of constellation (I2, I3, I4...) have been deployed at different
locations. Historically they were evenly spread around the globe (Atlantic-E,
Atlantic-W, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean) but more recent constellations have
been located to provide higher capacity in areas of the Earth with higher
traffic density (EMEA or Alphasat for example). The strong limitation of
geostationary satellites is the total lack of terrestrial coverage above
approximately 82°N or S, and partial loss of coverage at even lower latitudes
at the longitudes where the coverage areas of adjacent satellites overlap. This
is because the signal from the satellite tangents the Earth's surface at these
locations.

![][20007]

![][20008]

To communicate, the aircraft (Aircraft Earth Station, AES) links to the nearest
available satellite. Each satellite links to the ground via dedicated ground
stations (Ground Earth Stations, GES, such as Fucino, or Paumalu) within the
coverage area of the associated satellite. The call is then routed to the final
user using a dedicated ground network.

A typical Inmarsat Satellite Data Unit (SDU) contains 4 simultaneously usable
channels (2 for cockpit voice, 1 for cockpit data and 1 for passenger services)
and is connected via an amplifier to an antenna located on the upper fuselage.
The antenna is usually an electrically steered phase array-type; the steering
is required to avoid excessive transmitting power and to correctly receive the
relatively weak signal coming from the satellite. The phase array technique
allows a flat antenna which does not have a high drag penalty. Transmissions in
the L-band occur between 1.5 and 1.6 Ghz for AES to/from satellite (4-6 GHz is
used for satellite to/from GES).

Within each satellite coverage area, the transmitted power from the satellite
can be modulated across a number of areas known as spot beams, which provide
higher capacity in areas where there is more traffic.

**IRIDIUM**

The main benefit of the Iridium constellation is that it provides global
coverage. A total of 66 satellites (plus spares) at 780 km are in highly
inclined Low Earth Orbits. As well as being linked to users such as aircraft,
the satellites are always linked to each other. Communications are routed from
aircraft to satellite and between satellites until reaching a satellite which
is view of the unique ground station in the USA. The call is then routed to the
final user using a dedicated ground network.

An SDU is installed on the aircraft, typically with only two channels for
simultaneous use (1 for cockpit voice and 1 for cockpit data) along with a
small, non-steerable antenna on the upper fuselage. The aircraft is always in
view of at least one satellite as they pass overhead; the Iridium network
manages the switching between satellites to ensure seamless communications. As
for Inmarsat, capacity is increased via the use of spotbeams, and L-band is
used for AES to/from satellite communications.

### Test Objectives

In addition to the objectives below, functional tests of cockpit data or
passenger service applications may be assessed if relevant. Contrary to VHF or
HF radios, range is never an issue for SATCOM systems.

#### Coverage

**INMARSAT**

There are several aspects to be considered.

1. For an aircraft in straight & level flight, the elevation of the satellite
antenna reduces with geographic latitude until it reaches 0° at 82° N or S.
However, the elevation of the satellite antenna can also be reduced during
aircraft maneuvers. For example, the elevation of the I4-F2 satellite seen from
western Europe is approximately 11°. Therefore, if the aircraft is facing the
satellite, the antenna elevation will be zero at an aircraft pitch attitude of
11°. The antenna elevation will also be at 0° if the aircraft is at a bank
angle of 11° and the aircraft heading is perpendicular to the azimuth of the
satellite antenna. It should be demonstrated that communications are possible
whenever the antenna elevation is positive.

2. Even with positive antenna elevations, masking can occur if a structural
element is in the path of the communication beam. For example, in straight &
level flight directly away from a satellite, particularly at higher latitudes,
the satellite beam may pass through the vertical tailplane.

3. Although the satellite antenna elevation and azimuth does not change
significantly when switching between spotbeams, there is a change of parameters
in the system. Testers should verify the seamless nature of a spotbeam
handover.

4. Switching between satellites is less transparent because the antenna
elevation and azimuth change at the boundary between satellite coverage areas.
The changes may be quite significant, for example at very low latitudes close
to the equator, an antenna switching between the I4-Alphasat and I4-Americas
satellite will experience an azimuth change of 180°. There is therefore a
communication interruption. According to the system definition, it must be
verified if communications are re-established and to what extent. Generally
speaking, cockpit data services automatically recover whereas cockpit voice and
passenger services need to be reconnected.

**Iridium**

As previously discussed, the Iridium system continuously switches between
satellites to give the best available connection. As a result, coverage is
almost guaranteed and there are no specific cases to be addressed. Transient
masking may be experienced but following an interruption to communications, a
new non-masked satellite is automatically selected.

**Audio and control integration**

The same comments as for VHF testing apply for SATCOM testing.

**Non-interference**

The principal issue with SATCOM, particularly Inmarsat, is the rather high
radiated power. This means that even systems which are not operating on close
frequencies (actual or harmonic) may be affected by SATCOM transmissions from
the aircraft.

On the other hand, on many civil aircraft, as there is only one SATCOM antenna,
there is no issue for interference between SATCOM channels. This may however be
an issue on aircraft with more than one SATCOM antenna, operating in the same
frequency band.

### Weather conditions

Generally speaking, satellite communications in the L-band are not
significantly affected by different weather conditions. This is not the case
for Ka or Ku band signals which are strongly degraded by clouds and/or
precipitation between the AES and the satellite.

### Test technique

#### Coverage

**INMARSAT**

Initially, the correct performance of the system is determined by performing a
number of air/ground and ground/air communications in straight and level cruise
flight. It can also be useful to establish a communication and see if it
remains in place during operational aircraft maneuvers. If masking is
encountered, show interruptions are justified when considering the antenna
position the fuselage, and taking into account the relative positions of the
aircraft and the satellite.

To more precisely identify the correct antenna coverage, establish
communication and leave it in place. The aircraft performs a series of 360°
turns at incrementally increasing bank angles for each turn. It should be
demonstrated that no loss in communication occurs at any time during the turns
until the bank angle exceeds the satellite elevation expected for the location
of the testing. Even above that bank angle, there will be sectors of the turn
when the antenna is "facing" the satellite and communications may still be
possible, so it is important to complete the 360° turn. There is no specific
CS25/Part 25 requirement for a minimum bank angle; rather it should be shown
that there is no loss within a normal operational domain (for example, the bank
angles achieved during autopilot turns across minor heading changes at high
altitude).

To check system behavior at spotbeam or satellite handovers, obtain a detailed
coverage map and fly a specific route which crosses the boundaries. In general,
switching occurs when the received signal drops below a minimum power threshold
rather than at a precise geographic location; it is therefore important to plan
a flight route perpendicular to the predicted handover boundary and which
extends beyond it for a significant distance.

**Iridium**

Verify acceptable system performance by executing a number of air/ground and
ground/air communications in a range of aircraft positions and attitudes. It
can also be useful to establish a communication and determine if it remains in
place during operational aircraft maneuvers.

**Audio and control integration**

The same comments as for VHF testing apply for SATCOM testing.

**Non-interference**

As the beam for satellite communications is highly directional, interference
between the SATCOM and other aircraft systems generally only occurs when the
beam directly falls on the antenna or other component of another aircraft
system. It is therefore necessary to place the aircraft in a very specific
attitude, as a function of the position of the aircraft, the specific location
of the system under test, and according to the satellite in use. While in this
specific attitude, execute SATCOM communications and note any impact on the
system under study. For example, to check for interference of a SATCOM
communication on an MMR (or GPS) antenna, with a SATCOM antenna on the upper
central fuselage and an MMR antenna on the upper forward fuselage, requires an
aircraft flying in western Europe and using the I4-F2 satellite to fly at a
pitch of 11° on a heading of 112°.

### Safety

The output power of SATCOM systems, especially Inmarsat, is considerably higher
than other communication means. As a result, it is generally recommended not to
perform SATCOM communications if there are maintenance personnel close to the
aircraft. SATCOM test flights can be very long with just a few moments of
"excitement" at a satellite handover boundary. Crew fatigue and loss of
concentration is therefore to be carefully assessed.

### Tips and hints

Generally speaking, cockpit HMIs do not provide information on which
satellite/spotbeam combination is being used, even if for Inmarsat systems it
is usually possible to identify the satellite and GES in use. It is also very
rare to be able to identify antenna azimuth and elevation in real time.
Therefore, when possible, it is strongly recommended to connect a test tool --
which is generally specific to the SDU manufacturer -- which allows to access
such information in real time. This allows quick identification of masking or
handover issues.

A number of publicly available internet sites allow the quick and easy
calculation of expected antenna elevations and azimuths as a function of
aircraft position, for example [www.dishpointer.com].

In particular for satellite handovers, the required flight routes can be very
long and may well be in oceanic airspace. As a result, it is almost always
required to follow a flight plan and therefore rarely possible to repeat the
overflight of the handover boundary. It is therefore important to involve all
actors to maximize the success of the check (ATC, design office, SDU or other
system components suppliers, satellite operator, ground network operator,
etc.).

## Other communication systems

### SELCAL

Although often tested in parallel with the radios, strictly speaking, SELCAL
(SELective CALling) is a function of the audio management system rather than of
the VHF or HF radios. It allows a ground station to generate a buzzer in the
cockpit of an aircraft - even when the aircraft is not actively listening to
the tuned frequency (HF during oceanic sectors, for example). It relies on both
aircraft and ground station being tuned to the same frequency, for the ground
station to know in advance the four-letter SELCAL code of the aircraft. The
ground station sends an audible signal, made up of a mixture of tones, which
corresponds to the SELCAL code of the aircraft. The AMU decodes the signal and
sounds the buzzer.

A number of rules govern the list of available SELCAL codes, such that their
number is rather limited compared to the number of aircraft flying at any one
time. As a result, the same code may be used by several aircraft. If they
happen to be in the same geographical region and on the same frequency, there
is the potential for more than one aircraft to be contacted at the same time. A
simple voice check clarifies the situation.

### TVHF

Tactical VHF (TVHF) communications, principally for military users, use 30-88
MHz frequencies. Although this is seen as an extension of the VHF range, and
therefore used and tested in a similar fashion, the wavelengths of such
frequencies are rather long. As a result, antennas which are designed for VHF
applications but used for TVHF applications are not well-adapted. Tunable
antennas are sometimes implemented to improve performance.

TVHF wavelengths would benefit from increased transmission power, but this is
not generally the case. As a result, it can be difficult or even impossible to
meet the range performance requirements of VHF radios. Since TVHF is rarely
certified for civilian operations under CS25/Part 25, the qualification
requirements discussed with military operators have to be carefully defined to
avoid difficult discussions.

### Maritime radio

Some large aircraft, typically those used for search and rescue or maritime
patrol activities, are equipped with maritime radio. The frequency band is
156-174 MHz. The specificity of such radios is that the frequencies are
automatically stored under channel numbers. Some channel numbers refer to a
pair of frequencies, the so-called "ship" and "shore" roles, which allows full
duplex communications. In maritime applications, vessels logically use the ship
role and ground stations the shore role. In aeronautical applications, the
aircraft needs to be able to perform the ship role (for coordination with a
ground station) or the shore role (for communication with a vessel). To further
complicate matters, the pre-defined tables of frequencies are different in
different geographical locations. Testing, which is done in the same way as
standard VHF radios, requires the involved parties to agree on precisely which
channel, role and geographical table will be used.

### V/UHF

V/UHF (Very/Ultra High Frequency) is a further extension of the VHF domain
towards higher frequencies, including into the lowest parts of the UHF
spectrum, exclusively used by the military in aeronautical applications. The
frequencies range from 225- 400 MHz and both AM and FM modulations may be
available. Testing is performed in the same way as standard VHF radios.

### ALE

ALE (Automatic Link Establishment) is an HF-radio technology that alleviates
the need for the crew to manually tune the HF-radio at different frequencies to
reach a given ground station. Instead, a "network" of frequencies is shared by
the aircraft and the ground station, and the HF radio equipment in both
aircraft and ground station automatically identify the best frequency as
function of range, aircraft positon, atmospheric conditions, etc. The selection
of the frequency and its continuous update all along the transmissions is
completely transparent to the crew.

### Encryption technologies

Whatever the frequency band, it is possible to use different encryption
techniques to secure communications. In principle these techniques do not have
any impact on the range or masking performance of the communication means, but
audio and control integration must be carefully tested to ensure the correct
encryption and decryption. There are two principal methods of encryption:

* COMSEC (communications security): the signal is modified in such a way that a
listener not equipped with encryption key cannot understand the content of the
message. The same encryption key must be used by both aircraft and ground
station to encrypt the message before transmission and to decrypt it upon
reception.

* TRANSEC (transmission security), for example HAVEQUICK or SATURN. The most
commonly used technology is frequency hopping: the radios automatically cycle
through a set of different frequencies according to an order and time schedule
which is defined in an encryption key which must be loaded in both aircraft and
ground station.

It is possible to combine both methods of encryption.
