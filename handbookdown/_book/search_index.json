Although individual organizations generally are consistent in-house, confusion often arises when trying to mathematically translate inputs &amp; deflections from one organization to another. This section documents the generally accepted “body axes” sign conventions then discusses the rationale for several viewpoints addressing the “inputs &amp; deflections” debate. Below is the SFTE sign convention. Wind Axes Sign Convention Winds are listed according to the direction they are coming from. Airports refer winds to magnetic North while winds at altitude are typically referred to true North. Headwind is true airspeed minus ground speed. (Vw=VT-Vg). Body Axes Sign Convention The generally accepted body axes sign convention is based on the establishment of a three-dimensional axis system with the following properties: 1. It is right-handed orthogonal 2. Its origin is at the vehicle's reference center of gravity (defined by builder). 3. The axis system moves with the airframe. Translational displacements, rates, accelerations, &amp; forces are positive along the positive body axes directions. In spite of the simplicity of this logic, it is important to recognize that lift and normal load factor are positive in the negative z direction and the drag is positive in the negative x direction. Angular displacements, rates, accelerations &amp; moments, are positive according to the “right hand rule” (a clockwise rotation while looking in the direction of the positive axis) as shown in the figure. The body axes, forces &amp; translations along them, and moments &amp; rotations about them are shown with arrows indicating the positive direction. Angular displacements, rates, accelerations &amp; moments, are positive according to the “right hand rule” (a clockwise rotation while looking in the direction of the positive axis) as shown in the figure. The body axes, forces &amp; translations along them, and moments &amp; rotations about them are shown with arrows indicating the positive direction. Angle of attack is positive clockwise from the projection of the velocity vector on the xz plane to the reference x body axis. The angle of sideslip is positive clockwise from the xz plane to the velocity vector (wind in the pilot’s right ear). Aircraft true heading is the angle between true North and the projection of the x-body axis onto the horizontal plane. Mag. heading refers to mag North The velocity vector is measured relative to the air mass while the flightpath is measured relative to the ground. They are equivalent only when winds are zero. Flightpath heading angle (ground track heading) σg, is the horizontal angle between true North and the projection of the flightpath on the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is from north to east. € Flightpath elevation angle; γ, is the vertical angle between the flightpath and the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is up. During a descent, this parameter is commonly known as glide path angle. Flightpath bank angle; μ, is the angle between the plane formed by the velocity vector and the lift vector and the vertical plane containing the velocity vector. Positive rotation is clockwise about the velocity vector, looking forward. Fuselage reference station (FRS), Water line (WL), and Buttock line (BL) are reference coordinates established by the design group.

["discussion-of-input-deflection-conventions.html", "2 Discussion of “Input &amp; Deflection” Conventions 2.1 International Phonetic Alphabet and Morse Code", " 2 Discussion of “Input &amp; Deflection” Conventions The debate regarding proper inputs and deflections stems from the user’s viewpoint. From the body axis convention above, flight testers recognize that a climbing right turn generates positive angular measurements. Logically then, pull, right roll and right yaw pilot inputs and subsequent surface deflections should also be positive. The traditional flight tester’s convention follows as “All input forces &amp; displacements, surface deflections, and motions that cause a climbing right turn are positive.” Due to differential nature of aileron deflections, they require more discussion. The flight tester’s logic implies (but does not dictate) positive deflections are right aileron up and left aileron down. It is, however, equally acceptable to assign downward (or upward) deflection as positive for both ailerons and calculate the difference between the two as a measure of rolling moment. The rationale within the wind tunnel community is also logical: any control surface deflection that increases lift is positive. From this, positive deflections are trailing edge down (TED) for each: trailing edge flap, stabilizer, elevator, stabilator, rollervator, ruddervator, canard, aileron, flaperon, and all their tabs. Leading edge flap down is also positive. Similarly, since side force is positive to the right, then positive rudder and rudder tab deflections are trailing left (TEL). The only exception to this straightforward logic is for spoilers and speed brakes that extend only in one direction: this deflection is positive even though it might decrease the lift. Since the above rationale defines downward deflection as positive for both ailerons, a measurement of rolling moments requires calculation of the differential aileron deflection. This rationale does not, however, specifically dictate whether a “positive” differential deflection should generate right wing down (RWD) or left wing down (LWD) moments. Differential aileron can be calculated as either. \\(\\delta_{a} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\text{aR}} - \\delta_{\\text{aL}}}{2}\\) or \\(\\delta_{a} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\text{aL}} - \\delta_{\\text{aR}}}{2}\\) Selection of the RWD convention is obvious from the flight tester’s viewpoint since deflections that generate right rolls are positive. An alternative interpretation is that a positive differential aileron deflection is one that lifts the positive (right) wing lifts more than the left (LWD). Another common convention for ailerons is one that gives the same sign to both ailerons for any input. The “right hand screw” convention is opposite to the flight tester’s convention, but may be more common: δaR = +TED, δaL = +TEU. The above wind tunnel rationale dictates only the polarity for individual control surface deflections, and leaves open the sign convention debate about controller (inceptor) input forces &amp; displacements. One approach is that positive inputs should generate positive motions while an alternate approach is that positive inputs generate positive surface deflections. Only the flight tester’s convention states that positive inputs yield positive motions and deflections. All approaches are mathematically connected to the hinge moment sign convention discussed below. The simplest control surface hinge moment convention is that all positive hinge moments (generated by the pilot and the aerodynamics) move the surface in a positive direction, i.e., positive input forces yield positive deflections. This has different implications for the different sign conventions: • According to the above flight tester’s sign convention, a positive pull force is required to generate a positive (TEU) elevator deflection (positive stick force generates a climb). • According to wind tunnel sign convention, a positive push force is required to generate a positive (TED) elevator deflection (positive stick force generates a dive). The alternate viewpoint defines a positive inceptor hinge moment as one that opposes the aerodynamic moments. In other words, a positive inceptor hinge moment moves the surface to a position which generates positive aerodynamic hinge moments or “positive input forces &amp; displacements generate negative surface deflections.” Based on the above background, the SFTE technical council proposes the following standard convention for inceptor &amp; surface forces &amp; deflections: • Due to its widespread use and its simple &amp; robust nature, use the wind tunnel convention for control surface deflections. • Due to widespread test pilot &amp; FTE familiarity and logical nature, use the flight tester’s convention that positive inceptor forces &amp; displacements generate a climbing right turn. • A fallout from these conventions is that positive inceptor hinge moments generate positive aerodynamic hinge moments (negative surface deflections). • Consistent use of the above logic requires that the calculated value for aileron deflection be negative for right wing down moments. Similarly, differential ruddervator deflections generating nose right yawing moments should have negative values.

Historically, Dutch, U.S. and some British aircraft use a climbing right turn, while it is a diving left turn for Canadian, Australian, and some British aircraft. The SFTE Technical Council recognizes that several combinations of the above possibilities are currently in use around the world, and invites comments, additions, or corrections to the above summary and proposal. Although SFTE does not expect all organizations to adopt this standard, it still provides a cornerstone for reference purposes 1.7 Thermodynamics Relations (references 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6) A Process is an event with a redistribution of energy within a system. A Reversible process is one that can be reversed such that the system returns to its original state (form, location &amp; amount). An Irreversible process cannot return to its original state due to heat flow from higher to lower temperatures, fluid turbulence, friction, or inelastic deformation. The change in entropy is non-zero. An Isothermal process is one in which the temperature of the fluid is constant. An Adiabatic process is one in which heat is not transferred to or from the fluid. Work is the energy transfer by way of changing mechanical energy. Heat is the energy transfer from one body to another by virtue of a temperature difference between them. An Isentropic process has constant entropy. Conduction is the energy transfer from a warmer body by tangible contact (transfer of some internal molecular kinetic energy). Convection is the repositioning the energy of a fluid without state changes or energy transformations (e.g. heated air moving from one room to another room). Radiation is the energy transmission through space.

Perfect gas law): PV=RT, P = ρRT, PV = mRT, PV = nRT δ = σθ where δ Pa/Po, σ = ρa/ρo, θ = Ta/To Boyle’s Law states that when the temperature of a given mass of gas is held constant, then the volume and pressure vary inversely. Charle’s Law states that when a volume of a given mass is held constant, then the change in pressure of the gas is proportional to the change in temperature.
