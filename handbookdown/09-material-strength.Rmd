## Material Stress & Strain

**Stress** (\(\sigma\)) is the ability of a material to react a force distributed over some area. In the simple axial load case this can be presented as

\[
  \sigma = \frac{P}{A}
\]

\[
  \begin{align}
  \text{where } \sigma &= \text{the applied axial load} \\
  A &= \text{cross-sectional area over which the load is applied} \\
  \end{align}

**Strain** (\(e\)) is the deformation of a material under an applied load. In the basic form this can be presented as

\[
  e = \frac{\Delta L}{L}
\]

where \(\Delta L\) is the change in dimension due to some load, and \(L\) is the original dimension

The **stress-strain relationship** is linear (proportional) for a large percentage of the applied load to the maximum, as expressed by the **Modulus of Elasticity** (**Young's Modulus**)

\[
  E = \frac{\sigma}{e}
\]

A typical stress & strain relationship for a material is illustrated as

![][09002]

## V-n Diagram

**Flight Path Normal Load Factor** \( \left(N_{zw} \right) \) can be expressed during level flight, as

\[
  \begin{align}
  N_{zw} &= \frac{1}{\cos \phi} = \frac{L}{W} \\
  \text{where } C_L &= \text{lift coefficient} \\
  F_n &= \text{net thrust} \\
  L &= \text{lift force} = \text{wing lift} + \text{thrust lift} = C_L qS + F_n \sin \alpha_F \\
  q &= \text{dynamic pressure} \\
  S &= \text{wing area} \\
  W &= \text{gross weight} \\
  \alpha_F &= \text{incidence angle between thrust line and relative wind} \\
  \phi &= \text{angle of bank}
  \end{align}


**Body Axis Normal Load Factor**  \( \left(N_{zb} \right) \) is calculated as

\[
  \begin{align}
  N_{zb} &= \frac{N_{zw} - N_{xb} \sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha} \\
  \text{where } N_{xb} &= \text{load factor along aircraft body x-axis} \\
  \alpha &= \text{angle of attack} \\
  \end{align}

For the simplified case of negligible thrust lift, the maximum achievable \( N_{zb} \) at any flight speed can be calculated as

\[
  \begin{align}
  N_{zb} &= \left( \frac{V}{V_s} \right)^2 \\
  \text{where } &\text{both speeds must be the same units} \\
  &\text{(i.e., true, equivalent, calibrated)} \\
  V &= \text{flight airspeed} \\
  V_s &= \text{stall airspeed} \\
  \end{align} 

A general normal load flight envelope (V-n diagram) would appear as

* The envelope typically varies with:
  * asymmetric loading
  * aircraft configuration
  * for air loads other than along the normal axis
  * and other structural, system, and safety considerations.

![][09003]

* It is frequently desirable to correct measured (test) \( N_{zb} \) data to a standard weight or design gross weight ( \( \mathrm{GW} \) ) using the relationship

\[
  \begin{align}
  N_{zb} &= N_{zw_{\text{test}}} \frac{W_t}{W_s} \\
  \text{where } W_t &= \text{test weight} \\
  W_s &= \text{standard weight} \\
  \end{align}

* The increase in load factor due to a vertical gust \( \Delta n \) is calculated as

\[
  \begin{align}
  \Delta n &= \frac{0.155 m V_e \left( \mathrm{KU} \right) }{\frac{W}{S}} \\
  \text{where } m &= \text{slope of } C_{L_{\alpha}} \text{ curve} \\
  V_e &= \text{equivalent airspeed (knots)} \\
  \mathrm{KU} &= \text{effective gust velocity (fps)} \\
  \frac{W}{S} &= \text{wing loading (psf)} \\
  \end{align}

## Strain Gages

The three strain gage configurations most commonly used are

![][09004]

Strain \( \left( e \right) \) is measured using the electrical resistance measured via the strain gage in a material subject to load. For the uniaxial gauge

\[
  \begin{align}
  K &= \frac{ \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right) }{e} \\
  \text{where } K &= \text{gage factor (provided by manufacturer)} \\
  R &= \text{unstrained resistance} \\
  \Delta R &= \text{change in resistance due to load} \\
  & + \Delta R \text{ for tension} \\
  \end{align}

* For the bi-axial gage oriented coincident with the principal axes (maximum strain), each leg of the gage is analyzed as a uniaxial gage using the above equation for the principle strains. The associated stresses are

\[
  \begin{align}
  \sigma_{\text{max}} &= E \frac{e_{\text{max}} + \nu e_{\text{min}}}{1 - \nu^2} \\
  \sigma_{\text{min}} &= E \frac{e_{\text{min}} + \nu e_{\text{max}}}{1 - \nu^2} \\
  \text{where } & e_{\text{max}} \text{ and } e_{\text{min}} \text{ are the measured principal strains in the appropriate legs of the bi-axial gage} \\
  E &= \text{Young's Modulus of the material} \\
  \nu &= \text{Poisson's ratio for the material (ratio of compression and tension strains)} \\
  \end{align}

* For the Rosette gage, the principal strains and stresses are derived as

\[
  \begin{align}
  e_{\text{max,min}} &= 0.5 \left(e_a + e_c \right) \pm 0.5 \sqrt{\left(e_a - e_c \right)^2 + \left(2e_b - e_a - e_c \right)^2  } \\
  \sigma_{\text{max,min}} &= 0.5 E \left[ \frac{e_a + e_c}{1 - \nu} \right] \pm 0.5 \frac{\sqrt{\left(e_a - e_c \right)^2 + \left(2e_b - e_a - e_c \right)^2  }}{1 - \nu} \\
  \text{where } & e \text{ denotes the strain in each of the three legs of the Rosette} \\
  &\text{(+ is used for the maximum and - for the minimum)} \\
\end{align}

To accurately measure the very small resistance changes in a strain gage, a *Wheatstone Bridge* is typically used
