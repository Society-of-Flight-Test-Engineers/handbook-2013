Annealing A heat treatment that eliminates the effects of cold working.

**9.2 Material Stress & Strain**

 

Stress (*σ*) is the ability of a material to react a force distributed over some area. In the simple axial load case this can be presented as

*σ = P/A*

 

where *P* = the applied axial load

*A* = cross-sectional area over which the load is applied

 

*Strain* (*e*) is the deformation of a material under an applied load. In the basic form this can be presented as

\* *

*e = ∆L/L*

 

where *∆L* is the change in dimension due to some load, and *L* is the original dimension

 

The *stress-strain relationship* is linear (proportional) for a large percentage of the applied load to the maximum, as expressed by the *Modulus of Elasticity* (*Young's Modulus*)

 

*E = σ/e*

 

A typical stress & strain relationship for a material is illustrated as

 

![][09002]

**9.3 V-n Diagram**

** **

**Flight Path Normal Load Factor** (*N~zw~*) can be expressed during level flight, as

 

*N~zw~*= 1/*cosφ = L/W*

where *C~L\ ~*= lift coefficient

*F~n~*= net thrust

*L* = lift force = wing lift + thrust lift = *C~L~qS +F~n~sinα~F~*

*q* = dynamic pressure

*S* = wing area

*W* = gross weight

*α~F\ ~*= incidence angle between thrust line and relative wind

*φ* = angle of bank

** **

**Body Axis Normal Load Factor** (*N~zb~*) is calculated as

 

*N~zb~* = \[*N~zw~*-*N~xb~*sinα\]/cosα

€

where *N~zb\ ~*= load factor along aircraft body x-axis

α = angle of attack

 

For the simplified case of negligible thrust lift, the maximum achievable *N~zb~* at any flight speed can be calculated as

 

*N~zb~* = (*V/V~s~*)^2^

 

where both speed must be the same units

(i.e., true, equivalent, calibrated)

*V* = flight airspeed

*V~s~* = stall speed

 

A general normal load flight envelope (V-n diagram) would appear as

• The envelope typically varies with: asymmetric loading; aircraft configuration; for air loads other than along the normal axis; and other structural, system, and safety considerations.

 

 

 

 

 ![][09003]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• It is frequently desirable to correct measured (test) *N~zb~* data to a standard weight or design gross weight (*GW*) using the relationship

 

*N~zb~*= (test *N~zb~*)(*W*~t~*/W~s~)*

where *W*~t~ = test weight

*W~s~* = standard weight

 

• The increase in load factor due to a vertical gust *(∆n*) is calculated as

€

                        ∆n = 0.115*mV~e~(KU)/(W/S*)

 

where *m* = slope of C~Lα~ curve

*V~e\ ~* = equivalent airspeed (knots)

*KU* = effective gust velocity (fps)

*W/S* = wing loading (psf)

 

**9.4 Strain Gages**

 

The three strain gage configurations most commonly used are

 

 

 

 ![][09004]

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strain (*e*) is measured using the electrical resistance measured via the strain gage in a material subject to load. For the uniaxial gauge

 

*K = (∆R/R)/e*

where *K* = gage factor (provided by manufacturer)

*R* = unstrained resistance

*∆R* = change in resistance due to load

(+∆R for tension)

 

• For the bi-axial gage oriented coincident with the principal axes (maximum strain), each leg of the gage is analyzed as a uniaxial gage using the above equation for the principle strains. The

associated stresses are

 

*σ~max~ = E*(*e~max~ + υe~min~*)/(*1 -υ^2^*)

*σ~min~ = E*(*e~min~ + υe ~max~*)/(*1 - υ^2^*)

 

where *e~max~* and *e~min~* are the measured principal strains in the appropriate legs of the bi-axial gage, *E* is the Young's Modulus of the material, ν is Poisson's ratio for the material. (ratio of compression and tension strains)

 

• For the Rosette gage, the principal strains and stresses are derived as

 

 ![][09005]

 

 ![][09006]

 

 

 

where *e*'s denote the strains in each of the three legs of the Rosette (+ is used for the maximum and - for the minimum).

 

 

To accurately measure the very small resistance changes in a strain gage, a *Wheatstone Bridge* is typically used
