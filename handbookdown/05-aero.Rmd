## Dimensional Analysis Interpretations 

(ref 5.2)

Aerodynamic force = \(F\)

<!--- Fixme: what is the second bullet point referring to?  What is K? --->
* \(F = f \left( \rho \text{, } \mu, T \text{, } V \text{, shape, orientation, size, roughness, gravity} \right) \)
* For aircraft ignore \(R\), \(K\) & hypersonic effects

![][05001]

<!--- TODO: align the non-dimensional parameters (align equals sign) --->
* Initially assume similar body orientations, shapes & roughness.
* Dimensional Analysis reveals four non-dimensional (\(\pi\)) parameters:
    * Force Coefficient  \(\pi_1 = \frac{F}{\rho V^2 l^2} \)
    * Reynolds Number \(\pi_2 = \frac{\rho V l}{\mu} \)
    * Mach Number \(\pi_3 = \frac{V}{a} \)
    * Froude Number \(\pi_4 = \frac{V}{\sqrt{lg}} \)

A closer look at the force coefficient:

<!--- This force coefficient should probably be defined at the beginning of the section --->
\[C_F = \frac{F}{\rho V^2 l^2} => \frac{F}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S} \]

<!--- This doesn't really make sense.  What is "S" the same as? --->
where \(\frac{1}{2} \rho_a V_T^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_e^2 = \text{dynamic pressure}\text{, }q \)

Dimensions of reference wing area, \(S\) are the same

<!--- FIXME: m is not defined --->
<!--- FIXME: q doesn't need quotes --->
**A feel for \(q\)**

* Kinetic energy of a moving object = \(\frac{1}{2} m V_T^2 \)
* Block of moving air kinetic energy = \(\frac{1}{2} \rho \text{ (volume) } V_T^2 \)
* Dividing through by volume yields \(\mathrm{KE}\) per volume of moving air = \(\frac{1}{2} \rho V_T^2 \)
* "Dynamic pressure" or "\(q\)" = potential for converting each cubic foot of the airflow's kinetic energy into frontal stagnation pressure
* Feel \(q\) by extending your hand out the window of a moving car

**A feel for coefficients**

* \(C_F = (F/S)/q\) = the ratio between the total force pressure and the flow's dynamic pressure
* Lift is the component of the total force perpendicular to the free stream flow
* Drag is the component along the flow
* Break total into lift and drag coefficients:
    * \(C_L = (L/S)/q\)
    * \(C_D = (D/S)/q\)
* Increasing dynamic pressure generates a larger total force, lift and drag

![][05005]

* Froude number is not significant in aerodynamic phenomena
* Recall that forces are also a function of angle of attack, shape & surface roughness, therefore

\[C_L,C_D = f \left[ M \text{, } \mathrm{Re} \text{, } \alpha \right] \text{ for a given shape, roughness} \]

![][05007]

*Note in the figure above the Reynolds effects are exaggerated*

<!--- FIXME: I don't like the inconcistent use of \mathrm{Rn} and \mathrm{Re} for Reynolds number --->
To compare test day and standard day aircraft or to match wind tunnel \(C_F\) data to actual aircraft; the shape, roughness, \(M\), \(\mathrm{Rn}\) and \(\alpha\) must be equal for both aircraft

![][05009]

<!--- FIXME: Define these subscripts --->
\[\frac{L_A}{q_A S_A} = C_L = \frac{L_M}{q_M S_M} \]


<!--- FIXME: update references to dynamic cross references--->
## General Aerodynamic Relations 

(refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

Lift & Drag forces can be described using two approaches:

1. Change in momentum of airstream, \(F=d[mv]/dt\)
2. "Bernoulli" approach which requires the continuity and conservation of energy equations

**Continuity Equation**

Fluid Mass in = Fluid Mass out

\[\rho_1 V_1 A_1 = \rho_2 V_2 A_2\]

<!--- FIXME: Subsonic doesn't equate to incompressible --->
For subsonic (incompressible) flow \(\rho_1 = \rho_2\)

\[V_1 A_1 = V_2 A_2\]

**Conservation of Energy** (Bernoulli) **Equation:**

Potential + Kinetic + Pressure = constant (changes in Potential energy are negligible)

Energy per unit volume is pressure then Dynamic Pressure + Static Pressure = Total Pressure

\[\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 + p_s = \text{constant} \]
\[\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 + p_s = p_t \]

* This classic approach only applies in the "potential flow" region and not in the boundary layer where energy losses occur
* Pressures around a surface can be calculated or measured from tests and converted into pressure coefficients,

\[c_p = \left( p_{\mathrm{local}} - p_{\mathrm{ambient}} \right) / \text{dynamic pressure} = \Delta p/q \]

* \(c_p\) values can be mapped out for all surfaces

![][05011]

* Summation of all pressures perpendicular to surface yield the pitching moments and the "**Resultant Aerodynamic Force**" which is broken into lift and drag components

![][05012]

* Lift & drag forces are referred to the aerodynamic center (\(\mathrm{ac}\)) where the pitching moment is constant for reasonable angles of attack.
* Pitching moments increase with airfoil camber, are zero if symmetric.
* Aerodynamic center is located at 25% \(\mathrm{MAC}\) for fully subsonic flow and at 50% \(\mathrm{MAC}\) for fully supersonic flow.


## Wing Design Effects on Lift Curve Slope 

(refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

### Aspect Ratio Effect {-}

* Pressure differential at wingtip causes tip vortex

![][05013]

![][05014]

* Vortex creates flow field that reduces \(\mathrm{AOA}\) across wingspan

![][05015]

* Local \(\mathrm{AOA}\) reductions decrease average lift curve slope

![][05016]

*2D wing = wind tunnel airfoil extending to walls (infinite aspect ratio).*

\(a_0 = \text{Lift curve slope for an infinite wing} \)

\(a = \text{Lift curve slope for a finite wing}\)

* Above relationship estimated as \(\alpha = \frac{dC_L}{d \alpha} = \frac{a_0}{1+\frac{57.3 a_0}{\pi \mathrm{AR}}} \)

## Elements of Drag 

(refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

![][05024]

* Skin friction shear stress is a function of velocity profile at surface

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
    The following images are not rendering very clearly.  Additionally, some labels are missing from the figure (delta, dy, dv/dy)
    ```
![][05025]

<!--- Tau needs to be defined at the beginning of the section --->
Shear stress \(\tau_w = \mu \left( \frac{dv}{dy} \right)_{y=0} \)

* Viscosity \(\mu\) increases with temperature (ref 5.9)

Sutherland law: \(\mu = \mu_0 \frac{\left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{1.5} \left( T_0 + S \right)}{\left( T + S \right)} \)

Power law: \(\mu = \mu_0 \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^n \)

<!--- TODO: check to make sure the unit formatting is consistent with the style guide --->
Where \(T_0 = 273.15 \text{K} = 518.67 \text{R} \)

For air: \(S = 110.4 \text{K} = 199 \text{R} \text{; n=0.67} \) 

For air at \(273\) K : \(\mu_0 = 1.717 \times 10^{-5} \left[\text{kg/m s}\right] = 3.59 \times 10^{-7} \left[\text{slug/ft s}\right] \)

Inserting air values (\(T_K=\)Kelvin and \(T_R=\)Rankin) into Sutherland law gives

\[\mu = 1.458 \times 10^{-6} \frac{T_K^{1.5}}{T_K+110.4} \left[\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s m}}\right] = 2.2 \times 10^{-8} \frac{T_R^{1.5}}{T_R+199} \left[\frac{\text{slug}}{\text{s ft}}\right]\]

### Reynolds Number Effects 

(ref 5.10)

* Laminar boundary layers have more gradual change in velocity near surface than turbulent boundary layers.
* High Reynolds numbers help propagate turbulent flow.

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
    FIXME: This figure (05031) needs work
    ```
![][05031] 

Shearing stress: \(\tau_w = \mu \left(\frac{dv}{dy}\right)_{y=0}\)

Skin friction coefficient: \(C_f = \frac{\tau_w}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty} V_{\infty}^2} = \frac{\tau_w}{q_{\infty}} \)

Laminar boundary layer: \(\text{Total } C_f = \frac{1.328}{\left(\mathrm{Re}_L \right)^{1/2}} \)

Turbulent boundary layer: \(\text{Total } C_f = \frac{0.455}{\left(\log(\mathrm{Re}_L)\right)^{2.58}} \approx \frac{0.074}{\left(\mathrm{Re}_L\right)^{1/5}} \) 

![][05033]

\(\mathrm{Re}_L\) based on total length of flat plate

* Depth of boundary layer \((\delta)\) depends on local Reynolds number \((\mathrm{Re}_x)\) and whether the flow is turbulent or laminar.

\[\mathrm{Re}_x = \frac{\rho_{\infty} V_{\infty} x}{\mu_{\infty}} \equiv \frac{\text{Intertia Forces}}{\text{Viscous Forces}} \]

\(x = \) distance traveled to point in question

\[\delta_{\mathrm{lam}} = \frac{5.2x}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Re}_x}} \]

\[\delta_{\mathrm{turb}} = \frac{0.37x}{\mathrm{Re}_x^{0.2}} \]

### Pressure Drag

* Ideal frictionless flow has no losses and leads to zero pressure drag
* Real fluids have friction and energy losses along surface
* Energy losses negate total pressure recovery, lead to decreasing total pressure along surface

![][05036]

* Imbalance of pressures on surfaces causes pressure drag

  ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
  The following figures have (a), (b), (b), and (c) that not only don't really have any meaning, but also has a repeated (b)
  ```

![][05037]

![][05038]

* Profile streamlining reduces pressure drag

![][05039]

### Interference Drag

* Occurs with multiple surfaces approximately parallel to flow
* Caused by flow's interference with itself or by excessive adverse pressure gradient due to rapidly decreasing vehicle cross section
* Most severe with surfaces at acute angles to each other
* Effects often reduced by fillets around contracting surfaces

![][05040]

### Induced Drag

* Wingtip vortex reduces local \(\mathrm{AOA}\) at each station along wing
* Local lift vector is perpendicular to local \(\mathrm{AOA}\)
* Local lift vector is therefore tilted back relative to freestream lift
* Induced drag defined as rearward component of local lift vector

<!--- This image has an equation in it that should be cropped and put into the text --->
![][05041]

Induced Drag \[\left(D_i\right)=L\left(\alpha_i\right)\]

For elliptical lift distributions \(\alpha_i = \frac{C_L}{\pi \mathrm{AR}} \)

\[\therefore D_i = L \left(\frac{C_L}{\pi \mathrm{AR}}\right) \text{ but } L=qSC_L \]

\[C_{D_i} = \frac{D_i}{qS} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR}}\]

Oswald efficiency factor, \(e\), accounts for losses in excess of those predicted above (due to uneven downwash and changing interference drag effects).

\[\therefore C_{D_i} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR} e}\]

## Aerodynamic Compressibility Relations 

(ref 5.8)

  ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
  This whole section and it's formatting and numbering really need to be re-done.  Normal shocks don't have a subsection, but obliques do for instance.  Needs consistency
  ```

**Prandtl/Glauert Approximation**

Approximates Mach effects on aerodynamics below critical Mach

\[C_{P_{\mathrm{compressible}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-M^2}}C_{P_{\mathrm{incompressible}}} \]

**Total vs Ambient Property Relations for Adiabatic Flow**

\[\frac{T_T}{T} = 1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2 \text{   Isentropic flow not required}\]
\[\frac{P_T}{P} = \left[1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2 \right]^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} \text{   Isentropic (shockless) flow required}\]
\[\frac{\rho_T}{\rho} = \left[1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \right]^{\frac{1}{\gamma -1}} \text{   Isentropic flow required} \]


**Normal Shock Relations**

Assumes isentropic flow on each side of the shock
Assumes flow across shock is adiabatic
Property changes occur in a constant area (throat)

### Oblique Shocks

**Oblique Shock Description**

![][05048]

\[\delta = \text{surface turning angle}\]

\[\theta = \text{shock wave angle}\]

\[\text{Subscript 1 denotes upstream conditions}\]

\[\text{Subscript 2 denotes downstream conditions}\]

**Oblique Shock Relations**

* Calculate \(P_2/P_1\), \(T_2/T_1\), and \(\rho_2/\rho_1\) across oblique shocks by using normal shock equations and substituting \(M_1 \sin\theta\) in place of \(M_1\)
* Calculate total pressure loss across oblique shock as

\[\frac{P_{T_2}}{P_{T_1}} = \left[\left[\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} + \frac{2}{{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M_1^2\sin^2\theta}}\right]^{\gamma} \left[\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1} M_1^2\sin^2\theta - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} \right]\right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \gamma}}  \]

* Calculate relation between Mach number and angles as

\[M_2^2\sin^2\left(\delta - \theta\right) = \frac{M_1^2 \sin^2\theta + \frac{2}{\gamma-1}}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} M_1^2\sin^2\theta - 1} \]

**Oblique Shock Turning Angle as a Function of Wave Angle**

![][05051]

* Two \(\theta\) solutions exist for every \(M_1\) & \(\delta\) combination
    * These represent the strong and weak shock solutions
    * Weak shocks normally occur in nature
* There is a minimum Mach number for each turning angle
* The wave angle of a weak shock decreases with increased Mach
* For a given Mach number, \(\theta\) approaches \(\mu\) as \(\delta\) decreases

**Mach Cone Angle**

![][05052]

Minimum Wave Angle: \(\mu = \sin^{-1}\left(1/M\right) \)

### Supersonic Isentropic Expansion Relation

![][05053]

* The wave angle \(\mu\) determines where the lower pressure can be felt and thus where the flow can be accelerated
* As the flow accelerates, a new wave angle forms and the subsequent lower pressure further accelerates the flow
* Results in a series of Mach waves forming a "fan" until the flow turns and accelerates so that it is parallel to the new boundary

**Prandtl-Meyer Function**

Shows flow's required turning angle (\(\nu\)) to accelerate from one Mach number to another

\[\nu_M = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}} \left[\tan^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} \left(M^2 - 1\right)} \right] - \tan^{-1}\sqrt{M^2-1} \]

* If upstream Mach \((M_1) = 1\), then \(\nu_1 = 0\), and equation directly relates downstream Mach (\(M_2\)) to surface turning angle (\(\Delta \nu\))
* If \(M_1 > 1\), determine \(M_2\) as follows:
    * Calculate upstream ν~1~ from above equation
    * Calculate \(\nu_2 = \nu_1 + \Delta \nu \)
    * Reverse above equation to obtain corresponding \(M_2\)
* Above equation is tabulated in NACA TR 1135 and is plotted below

![][05055]

Example: Flow initially at \(M_1 = 2.0\) accelerates through an expansion corner of 24 deg. Exit Mach number is 3.0

### Two-Dimensional Supersonic Airfoil Approximations

* Determine surface static pressures by calculating changes through obliques shocks and expansion fans

![][05056]

* Ackert approximations for thin wings are based on

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
   I'm not sure if the "congruent" sign is the best symbol to use here.  Maybe approximately equal for consistency?
   ```

\[C_p = \frac{\Delta P}{q} \cong \pm\frac{2 \delta}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1}} \]

* Double wedge airfoil approximations

![][05058]

\[C_L \cong \frac{4 \alpha}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1} }\]

\[C_D \cong \frac{4 \alpha^2}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1}} + \frac{4}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1}}\left(\frac{t}{c}\right)^2\]

* Biconvex wing approximations

![][05061]

\[C_L \cong \frac{4 \alpha}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1} }\]

\[C_D \cong \frac{4 \alpha^2}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1}} + \frac{5.33}{\sqrt{M^2 - 1}}\left(\frac{t}{c}\right)^2\]


## Drag Polars 

(ref 5.2)

### Drag Polar Construction and Terminology

   ```{block, type='TODO', echo=FALSE}
   These really should be defined at the beginning of the section
   ```
\(C_L = \text{lift coefficient}\)

\(C_D = \text{drag coefficient}\)

\(C_{D_i} = \text{induced drag coefficient}\)

\(C_{D_0} = \text{parasitic drag coefficient}\)

\(\mathrm{AR} = \text{aspect ratio}\)

\(e = \text{Oswald efficiency factor}\)

\(l = \text{length flow has traveled}\)

\(S_{\mathrm{wet}} = \text{wetted area of surface}\)

\(S = \text{reference wing area}\)

**Simple Drag Polar Equation Limitations**

* No separated flow losses
* Symmetric Camber
* Applies at one Mach, Altitude, \(\mathrm{cg}\)

\[C_D = C_{D_0} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR} e} = C_{D_0} + C_{D_i}\]

"Polar" form of simple drag polar:

![][05062]

Linearized form of simple drag polar:

![][05064]

### Complicating Factors

#### Airflow Separation Effects {-}

![][05065]

Drag Polar Equation Accounting for Flow Separation:

\[C_D = C_{D_{\mathrm{min}}} + \frac{\left(C_L - C_{L_{\mathrm{min}}}\right)^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR} e} +k_2\left(C_L - C_{L_{\mathrm{break}}}\right)\]

* Delete last term if \(C_L < C_{L_{\mathrm{break}}} \)
* Determine \(k_2\) from flight test

#### Reynolds Number Effects {-}

(refs 5.4, 5.11)

* Calculate length \(\mathrm{Re}_L\) and friction coefficient (\(c_f\)) for each surface as

\[\mathrm{Re}_L = \frac{\rho Vl}{\mu} = 7.101 \times10^6 \left[\frac{\delta}{\theta^2} \right]\left[\frac{T_K + 110}{398}\right] l \]

\(T_K = \text{Kelvin} \)

\(l = \text{total length, ft}\)

\[c_f = \left[\frac{1.328}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Re}_L}}\right] \left[1 + 0.1305 M^2 \right]^{-0.12} \text{ laminar}\]
or
\[c_f = \left[\frac{0.074}{\left(\mathrm{Re}_L\right)^2} - \frac{1700}{\mathrm{Re}_L}  \right] \text{ transition}\]
or
\[c_f = 0.455\left[\log \mathrm{Re}_L\right]^{-258} \left[1 + 0.144 M^2\right]^{-0.65} \text{ turbulent}\]

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
   Inconsistent use of R_L and \mathrm{Rn} for Reynolds number
   Wetted area is already defined above and doesn't need to be redefined below
   ```
* In general, \(c_f\) decreases as \(\mathrm{Rn}\) increases (unless transitioning from laminar to turbulent flow)
* Friction drag \(= c_f q S_{\mathrm{wet}}\) for each component (\(S_{\mathrm{wet}} = \text{wetted area}\))
* Correct from test day to standard day aircraft drag coefficient by summing differences of each component's drag change

\[\Delta C_D = \frac{\sum\left(c_{f_s} - c_{f_t} \right) S_{\mathrm{wet}}}{S} \]

#### Wing Camber or Incidence Angle Effects {-}

Note slight increase in drag as lift decreases towards zero

![][05069]

Linearized drag polar for aircraft with wing camber and/or incidence

![][05070]

Revised drag polar equation accounting for wing camber or incidence

\[C_D = C_{D_{\mathrm{min}}} + \frac{\left(C_L - C_{L_{\mathrm{min}}} \right)^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR} e} \]

* Generally not necessary since most flight occurs above \(C_{L_{\mathrm{min}}}\)

#### Mach Number Effects {-}

* Aircraft with low parasitic drag coefficients and high fineness ratios pay a relatively small "wave drag" penalty.

![][05072]

* With external stores, same aircraft pays larger Mach penalty

![][05073]

#### Propeller Slipstream Effects {-}

* a.k.a "scrubbing" drag
* Propwash increases flow speed over surface within slipstream
* More drag is created by higher \(q\) and vorticity.
* Function of prop speed and power absorbed (\(C_p\)) or thrust (\(C_T\))
* Problem should be addressed in airframe or propeller models

#### Trim Drag Effects {-}

(ref 5.4)

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
   Why are the following being re-defined?
   ```
\(e = \text{wing Oswald efficiency factor} \)

\(e_t = \text{tail Oswald efficiency factor} \)

\(b = \text{span} \)

\(b_t = \text{tail span} \)

\(x = \text{wing ac-to-cg distance} \)

\(l = \text{wing ac to tail ac distance} \)

\(S = \text{Area} \)

![][05074]

\[C_{D_{\mathrm{trim}}} = \frac{W^2}{\pi q^2 Sb^2e} \left[\frac{2}{lW}\left[x_0 - x_1\right] + \frac{1}{l^2} \left[1 + \frac{S}{S_t} \frac{e}{e_t} \left(\frac{b}{b_t}\right)^2\right] \left[x_0^2 - x_1^2\right] \right]\]

Trim drag change relative to total induced drag:

\[\frac{\Delta C_{D_{\mathrm{trim}}}}{\Delta C_{D_i}} = \frac{x}{l} \left[\frac{x}{l} \left(\frac{b}{b_t}\right)^2 \frac{e}{e_t} - 2 \right] \]

Plot of above equation

![][05077]

### Drag Polar Analysis

\[D = \bar{q}SC_D = \bar{q}S \left[C_{D_0} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR} e} \right] = \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 V_e^2 S\left[C_{D_0} + \frac{W^2}{\pi \mathrm{AR} e \left(\frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_e^2 S \right)^2} \right]\]

* For a given configuration (\(C_{D_0} \text{, } S \text{, } \mathrm{AR} \text{, } e\))

\[D = k_1 V_e^2 + k_2 \frac{W^2}{V_e^2} \]

first term = parasitic drag, second term = induced drag

* For any given weight, \(D = f(\text{equivalent airspeed})\) only

![][05080]

* Minimum total drag occurs when \(D_{\mathrm{induced}} = D_{\mathrm{parasitic}}\)
    * same as speed where \(C_{D_i} = C_{D_0}\)
    * occurs at max \(C_L/C_D\) ratio (same as max \(L/D\) ratio)
* Minimum drag/velocity occurs at min slope of Drag vs V curve
    * same as speed where \(3C_{D_i} = C_{D_0}\)
    * occurs at max \(C_L^{1/2}/C_D\) ratio

Power required = drag x true airspeed

\[P_{\mathrm{req}} = DV_T = D\frac{V_e}{\sqrt{\sigma}} = k_1\frac{V_e^3}{\sqrt{\sigma}} + k_2\frac{W^2}{\sqrt{\sigma}V_e} \]

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
   Inconsistent use of 'req'd' and 'req'.  The following P_induced and P_parasitic    should be D for drag (not power)
   ```

Minimum total \(P_{\mathrm{req'd}}\) occurs when \(P_{\mathrm{induced}} = P_{\mathrm{parasitic}}\)

*  same as speed where \(C_{D_i} = 3C_{D_0} \)
*  occurs at max \(C_L^{3/2}/C_D\) ratio

Minimum power/velocity occurs at min slope of \(P_{\mathrm{req'd}}\) vs \(V\) curve

*  same as speed where \(C_{D_i} = C_{D_0}\)
*  occurs at max \(C_L /C_D\) ratio

**Optimum Aerodynamic Flight Conditions**

*Gliders/ Engine-Out Flight*

* Max range (minimum glide slope) occurs at max \(C_L/C_D\)
    * same as condition where \(C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}\) *if* drag polar is parabolic
* Min sink rate (minimum power req'd) occurs at max \(C_L^{3/2} /C_D\) ratio same as condition where \(3C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}\) *if* drag polar is parabolic

*Reciprocating Engine Aircraft (assuming constant \(\mathrm{BSFC}\) & prop \(\eta\))*

* Max range (minimum power/velocity) occurs at max \(C_L/C_D\) ratio
    * same as condition where \(C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}\) *if* drag polar is parabolic
* Max endurance (minimum power req'd) occurs at max \(C_L^{3/2} / C_D\)
    * same as condition where \(3C_{D_0} = C_{D_i}\) *if* drag polar is parabolic

*Turbine Jet Engine Aircraft (assuming constant \(\mathrm{TSFC}\))*

* Max range at constant altitude (minimum drag/velocity)
    * occurs at max \(C_L^{1/2} / C_D\) ratio
    * same as condition where \(C_{D_0} = 3C_{D_i}\) *if* drag polar is parabolic
* Best cruise/climb range (maximum \( \left[M \times L/D \right]\) ratio)
    * occurs at max \(C_L/C_D^{3/2}\) ratio
    * same as condition where \(C_{D_0} = 2C_{D_i}\) *if* drag polar is parabolic
* Best endurance (minimum drag)
    * occurs at max \(C_L/C_D\) ratio
