* For aircraft ignore *R*, *K* & hypersonic effects

<!--- TODO: align the non-dimensional parameters (align equals sign) --->
* Initially assume similar body orientations, shapes & roughness.
* Dimensional Analysis reveals four non-dimensional (\(\pi\)) parameters:
    * Force Coefficient  \(\pi_1 = \frac{F}{\rho V^2 l^2} \)
    * Reynolds Number \(\pi_2 = \frac{\rho V l}{\mu} \)
    * Mach Number \(\pi_3 = \frac{V}{a} \)
    * Froude Number \(\pi_4 = \frac{V}{\sqrt{lg}} \)

A closer look at the force coefficient:

<!--- This force coefficient should probably be defined at the beginning of the section --->
\[C_F = \frac{F}{\rho V^2 l^2} => \frac{F}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S} \]

<!--- This doesn't really make sense.  What is "S" the same as? --->
where \(\frac{1}{2} \rho_a V_T^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_e^2 = \textrm{dynamic pressure}, q \)
dimensions of reference wing area, \(S\) are the same

* Froude number is not significant in aerodynamic phenomena
* Recall that forces are aslo a function of angle of attack, shape & surface roughness, therefore

\[C_L,C_D = f[M, Re, \alpha] \]

## General Aerodynamic Relations (refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

Lift & Drag forces can be described using two approaches:

1. Change in momentum of airstream, \(F=d[mv]/dt\)
2. "Bernoulli" approach which requires the continuity and conservation of energy equations

**Continuity Equation**

Fluid Mass in = Fluid Mass out

\[\rho_1 V_1 A_1 = \rho_2 V_2 A_2\]

<!--- FIXME: Subsonic doesn't equate to incompressible --->
For subsonic (incompressible) flow \(\rho_1 = \rho_2\)

\[V_1 A_1 = V_2 A_2\]

**Conservation of Energy** (Bernoulli) **Equation:**

Potential + Kinetic + Pressure = constant
(changes in Potential energy are negligible)
Energy per unit volume is pressure then
Dynamic Pressure + Static Pressure = Total Pressure

<!---- TODO: Remove reference to 05010 --->

* This classic approach only applies in the "potential flow" region and not in the boundary layer where energy losses occur
* Pressures around a surface can be calculated or measured from tests and converted into pressure coefficients,

\[c_p = \left( p_{local} - p_{ambient} \right) / \textrm{dynamic pressure} = \Delta p/q \]

* \(c_p\) values can be mapped out for all surfaces

![][05011]

* Summation of all pressures perpendicular to surface yield the pitching moments and the "**Resultant Aerodynamic Force**" which is broken into lift and drag components

![][05012]

* Lift & drag forces are referred to the aerodynamic center (*ac*) where the pitching moment is constant for reasonable angles of attack.
* Pitching moments increase with airfoil camber, are zero if symmetric.
* Aerodynamic center is located at 25% MAC for fully subsonic flow and at 50% MAC for fully supersonic flow.


## Wing Design Effects on Lift Curve Slope (refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

### Aspect Ratio Effect {-}

* Pressure differential at wingtip causes tip vortex

![][05013]

![][05014]

* Vortex creates flow field that reduces AOA across wingspan

![][05015]

* Local AOA reductions decrease average lift curve slope

![][05016]

*2D wing = wind tunnel airfoil extending to walls (infinite aspect ratio).*

\(a_0 = \textrm{Lift curve slope for an infinite wing} \)

\(a = \textrm{Lift curve slope for a finite wing}\)

* Above relationship estimated as \(\alpha = \frac{dC_L}{d \alpha} = \frac{a_0}{1+\frac{57.3 a_0}{\pi AR}} \)

## Elements of Drag (refs 5.1, 5.2, 5.10)

* Skin friction shear stress is a function of velocity profile at surface

    ```

<!--- Tau needs to be defined at the beginning of the section --->
Shear stress \(\tau_w = \mu \left( \frac{dv}{dy} \right)_{y=0} \)

* Viscosity \(\mu\) increases with temperature (ref 5.9)

Sutherland law: \(\mu = \mu_0 \frac{\left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{1.5} \left( T_0 + S \right)}{\left( T + S \right)} \)

<!--- FIXME: remove reference to 05028 --->

Power law: \(\mu = \mu_0 \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^n \)

<!--- FIXME: remove reference to 05029 --->

<!--- TODO: check to make sure the unit formatting is consistent with the style guide --->
Where \(T_0 = 273.15 K = 518.67 R \)

For air: \(S = 110.4 K = 199 R \textrm{; n=0.67} \) 

For air at 273 K: \(\mu_0 = 1.717 \times 10^{-5} \textrm{[kg/m s]} = 3.59 \times 10^{-7} \textrm{[slug/ft s]} \)

Inserting air values (\(T_K=\)Kelvin and \(T_R=\)Rankin) into Sutherland law gives

\[\mu = 1.458 \times 10^{-6} \frac{T_K^{1.5}}{T_K+110.4} \left[\frac{\textrm{kg}}{\textrm{s m}}\right] = 2.2 \times 10^{-8} \frac{T_R^{1.5}}{T_R+199} \left[\frac{\text{slg}}{\text{s ft}}\right]\]

### Reynolds Number Effects (ref 5.10) {-}

* Laminar boundary layers have more gradual change in velocity near surface than turbulent boundary layers.
* High Reynolds numbers help propagate turbulent flow.

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
    FIXME: This figure (05031) needs work
    ```
![][05031] 

Shearing stress: \(\tau_w = \mu \left(\frac{dv}{dy}\right)_{y=0}\)

Skin friction coefficient: \(C_f = \frac{\tau_w}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\infty} V_{\infty}^2} = \frac{\tau_w}{q_{\infty}} \)

Laminar boundary layer: \(\textrm{Total } C_f = \frac{1.328}{\left(Re_L \right)^{1/2}} \)

Turbulent boundary layer: \(\textrm{Total } C_f = \frac{0.455}{\left(\log(Re_L)\right)^{2.58}} \approx \frac{0.074}{\left(Re_L\right)^{1/5}} \) 

   ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
   FIXME: remove references to 05032 and resize 05033
   ```

![][05033]

\(Re_L\) based on total length of flat plate

* Depth of boundary layer \((\delta)\) depends on local Reynolds number \((Re_x)\) and whether the flow is turbulent or laminar.

\[Re_x = \frac{\rho_{\infty} V_{\infty} x}{\mu_{\infty}} \equiv \frac{\textrm{Intertia Forces}}{\textrm{Viscous Forces}} \]

\(x = \) distance traveled to point in question

\[\delta_{lam} = \frac{5.2x}{\sqrt{Re_x}} \]

\[\delta_{turb} = \frac{0.37x}{Re_x^{0.2}} \]

### Pressure Drag

* Ideal frictionless flow has no losses and leads to zero pressure drag
* Real fluids have friction and energy losses along surface
* Energy losses negate total pressure recovery, lead to decreasing total pressure along surface

![][05036]

* Imbalance of pressures on surfaces causes pressure drag

  ```{block, type='FIXME', echo=FALSE}
  The following figures have (a), (b), (b), and (c) that not only don't really have any meaning, but also has a repeated (b)
  ```

![][05037]

![][05038]

* Profile streamlining reduces pressure drag

![][05039]

### Interference Drag

* Occurs with multiple surfaces approximately parallel to flow
* Caused by flow's interference with itself or by excessive adverse pressure gradient due to rapidly decreasing vehicle cross section
* Most severe with surfaces at acute angles to each other
* Effects often reduced by fillets around contracting surfaces

![][05040]

### Induced Drag

* Wingtip vortex reduces local AOA at each station along wing
* Local lift vector is perpendicular to local AOA
* Local lift vector is therefore tilted back relative to freestream lift
* Induced drag defined as rearward component of local lift vector

<!--- This image has an equation in it that should be cropped and put into the text --->
![][05041]

<!--- Remove 05042 --->
Induced Drag \[\left(D_i\right)=L\left(\alpha_i\right)\]

For elliptical lift distributions \(\alpha_i = \frac{C_L}{\pi AR} \)

\[\therefore D_i = L \left(\frac{C_L}{\pi AR}\right) \textrm{ but } L=qSC_L \]

\[C_{D_i} = \frac{D_i}{qS} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi AR}\]

Oswald efficiency factor, \(e\), accounts for losses in excess of those predicted above (due to uneven downwash and changing interference drag effects).

<!--- Remove 05043 --->
\[\therefore C_{D_i} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi ARe}\]

**Total vs Ambient Property Relations for Adiabatic Flow**

### Oblique Shocks

**Oblique Shock Description**

![][05048]

\[\delta = \textrm{surface turning angle}\]

\[\theta = \textrm{shock wave angle}\]

\[\textrm{Subscript 1 denotes upstream conditions}\]

\[\textrm{Subscript 2 denotes downstream conditions}\]

**Oblique Shock Relations**

* Calculate \(P_2/P_1\), \(T_2/T_1\), and \(\rho_2/\rho_1\) across oblique shocks by using normal shock equations and substituting \(M_1 \sin\theta\) in place of \(M_1\)
* Calculate total pressure loss across oblique shock as

\[\frac{P_{T_2}}{P_{T_1}} = \left[\left[\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} + \frac{2}{{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M_1^2\sin^2\theta}}\right]^{\gamma} \left[\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1} M_1^2\sin^2\theta - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} \right]\right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \gamma}}  \]

* Calculate relation between Mach number and angles as

\[M_2^2\sin^2\left(\delta - \theta\right) = \frac{M_1^2 \sin^2\theta + \frac{2}{\gamma-1}}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} M_1^2\sin^2\theta - 1} \]

**Oblique Shock Turning Angle as a Function of Wave Angle**

![][05051]

* Two \(\theta\) solutions exist for every \(M_1\) & \(\delta\) combination
    * These represent the strong and weak shock solutions
    * Weak shocks normally occur in nature
* There is a minimum Mach number for each turning angle
* The wave angle of a weak shock decreases with increased Mach
* For a given Mach number, \(\theta\) approaches \(\mu\) as \(\delta\) decreases

**Mach Cone Angle**

![][05052]

Minimum Wave Angle: \(\mu = \sin^{-1}\left(1/M\right) \)

### Supersonic Isentropic Expansion Relation

![][05053]

* The wave angle \(\mu\) determines where the lower pressure can be felt and thus where the flow can be accelerated
* As the flow accelerates, a new wave angle forms and the subsequent lower pressure further accelerates the flow
* Results in a series of Mach waves forming a "fan" until the flow turns and accelerates so that it is parallel to the new boundary

**Prandtl-Meyer Function**

Shows flow's required turning angle (\(\nu\)) to accelerate from one Mach number to another

\[\nu_M = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}} \left[\tan^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} \left(M^2 - 1\right)} \right] - \tan^{-1}\sqrt{M^2-1} \]

<!--- Remove 05054 --->

* If upstream Mach \((M_1) = 1\), then \(\nu_1 = 0\), and equation directly relates downstream Mach (\(M_2\)) to surface turning angle (\(\Delta \nu\))
* If \(M_1 > 1\), determine \(M_2\) as follows:
    * Calculate upstream ν~1~ from above equation
    * Calculate \(\nu_2 = \nu_1 + \Delta \nu \)
    * Reverse above equation to obtain corresponding \(M_2\)
* Above equation is tabulated in NACA TR 1135 and is plotted below

![][05055]

Example: Flow initially at \(M_1 = 2.0\) accelerates through an expansion corner of 24 deg. Exit Mach number is 3.0

### Two-Dimensional Supersonic Airfoil Approximations

* Determine surface static pressures by calculating changes through obliques shocks and expansion fans

## Drag Polars (ref 5.2)

### Drag Polar Construction and Terminology

*C~L~* = lift coefficient

*C~D~* = drag coefficient

*C~Di~* = induced drag coefficient

*C~Do~* = parasitic drag coefficient

AR = aspect ratio

*e* = Oswald efficiency factor

*l* = length flow has traveled

*S~wet~* = wetted area of surface

*S* = reference wing area

**Simple Drag Polar Equation Limitations**

* No separated flow losses

* Symmetric Camber

* Applies at one Mach, Altitude, *cg*

![][05062]

![][05063]

![][05064]

"Polar" form of simple drag polar

Linearized form of

simple drag polar

### Complicating Factors

**Airflow Separation Effects**

![][05065]

Drag Polar Equation Accounting for Flow Separation:

![][05066]

* Delete last term if *C~L~\<C~lbreak~*

* Determine *k*~2~ from flight test


**Reynolds Number Effects** (refs 5.4, 5.11)

* Calculate length *Re~L~* and friction coefficient (*c~f\ ~*) for each surface as

*T~K~* = Kelvin*,*

*l=* total length*,* ft)

![][05067]

* In general*, c~f\ ~* decreases as *R~n\ ~*increases (unless transitioning from laminar to turbulent flow)

* Friction drag *= c~f~ q S~wet~* for each component (*S~wet~* = wetted area)

* Correct from test day to standard day aircraft drag coefficient by summing differences of each component's drag change

![][05068]

**Wing Camber or Incidence Angle Effects**

![][05069]

Note slight increase in drag as lift decreases towards zero


Linearized drag polar for aircraft with wing camber and/or incidence

![][05070]

Revised drag polar equation accounting for wing camber or incidence

![][05071]

* Generally not necessary since most flight occurs above *C~Lmin~*

**Mach Number Effects**

* Aircraft with low parasitic drag coefficients and high fineness ratios pay a relatively small "wave drag" penalty.

![][05072]

* With external stores, same aircraft pays larger Mach penalty

![][05073]

**Propeller Slipstream Effects**

*  a.k.a "scrubbing" drag
*  Propwash increases flow speed over surface within slipstream
*  More drag is created by higher *q* and vorticity.
*  Function of prop speed and power absorbed (*C~p~*)or thrust (*C~T~*)
* Problem should be addressed in airframe or propeller models

**Trim Drag Effects** (reference 5.4)

e = wing Oswald efficiency factor

e~t~ = tail Oswald efficiency factor

b = span, b~t~ = tail span

*x* = wing *ac-*to-*cg* distance

*l*= wing *ac*-to tail *ac* dist.

S = Area

Trim drag change relative to

total induced drag:

![][05079]

first term *=* parasitic drag,

second term = induced drag

* For any given weight, *D* = *f*(equivalent airspeed) only

![][05080]

* Minimum total drag occurs when *D~induced~ = D~parasitic~*

same as speed where *C~Di~ = C~Do~*

* Minimum drag/velocity occurs at min slope of Drag vs V curve

same as speed where 3*C~Di~ =C~Do~*

occurs at max *C~L~ ^1/2^ /C~D~* ratio


Power required = drag x true airspeed

![][05081]

Minimum total *P~req'd~* occurs when *P~induced~ = P~parasitic~*

*  same as speed where *C~Di~ = 3C~Do~*

*  occurs at max *C~L~ ^3/2^ /C~D~* ratio

Minimum power/velocity occurs at min slope of *P~req'd~* vs *V* curve

*  same as speed where *C~Di~ =C~Do~*

*  occurs at max *C~L~ /C~D~* ratio


**Optimum Aerodynamic Flight Conditions**


*Gliders/ Engine-Out Flight*

* Max range (minimum glide slope) occurs at max *C~L~/C~D~*

same as condition where *C~Do~* = *C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic

* Min sink rate (minimum power req'd) occurs at max *C~L~^3/2^ /C~D~* ratio same as condition where 3*C~Do~* = *C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic


*Reciprocating Engine Aircraft (assuming constant BSFC & prop η)*

* Max range (minimum power/velocity) occurs at max *C~L~/C~D~* ratio

same as condition where *C~Do~* = *C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic

* Max endurance (minimum power req'd) occurs at max *C~L~^3/2^ /C~D~*

same as condition where 3*C~Do~* = *C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic

*Turbine Jet Engine Aircraft (assuming constant TSFC)*

* Max range at constant altitude (minimum drag/velocity)

occurs at max *C~L~ ^1/2^ /C~D~* ratio

same as condition where *C~Do~* = 3*C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic

* Best cruise/climb range (maximum \[*M* x *L/D*\] ratio)

occurs at max *C~L~/C~D~ ^3/2\ ^*ratio

same as condition where *C~Do~* = 2*C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic

* Best endurance (minimum drag)

occurs at max *C~L~/C~D~* ratio

same as condition where *C~Do~* = *C~Di~* *if* drag polar is parabolic
