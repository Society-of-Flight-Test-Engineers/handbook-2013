# The Electromagnetic Spectrum

## Electromagnetic Waves

All energy in the universe radiates in waves. Figure 1 depicts an 
electromagnetic wave, characterized by an electric field vector \( \left( E \right) \) and a 
magnetic field vector \( \left( H \right) \) oscillating orthogonal to each other. The 
electromagnetic wave propagation direction is determined by the right-hand rule 
and crossing the electric field into the magnetic field as illustrated. The 
electromagnetic wavelength \( \left( \lambda \right) \) is the distance between two consecutive electric 
field peaks. The electromagnetic wave frequency \( \left( f \text{ or } \nu \right) \) is inversely 
proportional to its wavelength. The product of any electromagnetic radiation's 
frequency and wavelength equals the speed of light \( \left( c = \lambda \nu \right) \).

Many aircraft and spacecraft systems operate within limited regions of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. Common examples include radar, electro-optical 
sensors, radios, data links, electronic warfare, and navigation systems.

## Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Radiation

One of the most heavily used regions of the electromagnetic spectrum is the 
radio frequency or RF spectrum, from \(\sim 3 \text{ kilohertz}\) to 
\(\sim 300 \text{ gigahertz}\). The RF Spectrum encompasses an array of 
telecommunications devices including radios, television, satellite 
communications, data links, radio-navigation aids, and radar. Table 1 shows how 
the RF Spectrum is subdivided into frequency bands.


|**Band Designation**         |**Label**  |**Frequency Spread**               |
|-----------------------------|:---------:|:---------------------------------:|
|Extremely Low Frequency      |ELF        |\(3 - 30 \text{ Hz}\)|
|Super Low Frequency          |SLF        |\(30 - 300 \text{ Hz}\)|
|Ultra Low (Voice) Frequency  |ULF or VF  |\(300 \text{ Hz} - 3 \text{ KHz}\)|
|Very Low Frequency           |VLF        |\(3 - 30 \text{ KHz}\)|
|Low Frequency                |LF         |\(30 - 300 \text{ KHz}\)|
|Medium Frequency             |MF         |\(300 \text{ KHz} - 3 \text{ MHz}\)|
|High Frequency               |HF         |\(3 - 30 \text{ MHz}\)|
|Very High Frequency          |VHF        |\(30 - 300 \text{ MHz}\)|
|Ultra High Frequency         |UHF        |\(300 \text{ MHz} - 3 \text{ GHz}\)|
|Super High Frequency         |SHF        |\(3 - 30 \text{ GHz}\)|
|Extremely High Frequency     |EHF        |\(30 - 300 \text{ GHz}\)|


**Table 1 - Radio Frequency Band Designations**

Depending on the type of RF system, additional subdivisions of the bands also 
exist. Table 2 applies to radar systems.

**Table 2 - Radar Frequency Band Designations**

Electromagnetic wave propagation does not stop at national boundaries. Most 
governments regulate radio frequency band use via **frequency** or 
**spectrum allocation**. For technical and economic reasons, governments try to 
harmonize and standardize RF band allocation. A number of forums and standards 
bodies address frequency allocation. The International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) is the United Nations agency for information and communication 
technologies. The ITU allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits and 
develops technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly 
interconnect. There are numerous users and spectrum allocation is complicated to 
implement and regulate. Figure 3 illustrates the United States frequency 
allocations.

## Optical Frequency Electromagnetic Radiation

Optical frequency electromagnetic radiation includes ultraviolet (UV), visible, 
and infrared (IR) light ranging from about 
\(0.01 \text{ microns} \left(\mu\text{m}\right)\) out to about 
\(1000 \mu\text{m}\) wavelength. These comprise the optical spectrum as shown in 
Figure 4.

Optical Spectrum

![][19003]

**Figure 4 - The Optical Spectrum and the Visible Spectrum**

Just as the RF spectrum can be subdivided into various special bands, Table 3 
shows bands in the optical spectrum. The visible, near infrared (NIR), mid wave 
IR (MWIR), and long wave IR (LWIR) bands are most commonly used for airborne 
electro-optical sensor systems. All bands can be useful, depending on the 
specific mission and operational requirements. 

[Editor's Note: Some band nomenclature and boundaries depend on author and text. 
SFTE has not established standards on this subject]

The most familiar example of electromagnetic radiation is the light spectrum 
humans see. Different colors of visible light have different wavelengths, 
ranging from violet at the shorter wavelengths \(\left(0.4 \mu\text{m}\right)\)
to red at the longer wavelengths \(\left(0.7 \mu\text{m}\right)\). Aerospace 
vehicles employ many visible light sensor systems. Visible light sensors provide 
useful and highly recognizable images, but logically enough, do not work well in 
poor visibility or at night without some sort of artificial illumination or 
image intensification.

![][19004]

**Table 3 - Optical Spectrum Bands**

Infrared radiation refers to the optical spectrum between 
\(\sim 0.7 \mu\text{m}\) and \(\sim 1000 \mu\text{m}\). Infrared radiation is 
popularly known as \"heat or thermal radiation\", but light and electromagnetic 
waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them. Infrared light from 
the sun accounts for \(\sim 49\%\) of earth heating, the rest is by visible light 
that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths. Objects at room 
temperature emit radiation mostly concentrated in the \(8\) to 
\(25 \mu\text{m}\) region.

Infrared sensors are useful in numerous civil and military remote sensing 
applications. At wavelengths beyond about \(14 \text{ microns}\), infrared 
radiation is not useful for most airborne remote sensing applications due to the 
earth's atmosphere attenuation. This is especially true in hot and humid 
atmospheric conditions with extreme infrared radiation attenuation.

## Atmospheric Transmission Windows

The sun is the earth's major source of natural energy across the electromagnetic 
spectrum and its radiation bombards the atmosphere constantly. The earth's 
atmosphere protects its life from excessive exposure to a range of higher energy 
waves such as Gamma rays, x-rays, and some ultraviolet waves. These are 
\"ionizing\" radiation because they have sufficiently high energy to knock 
electrons out of atoms, alter atoms and molecules, and damage organic cells. 
Figure 5 shows atmospheric opacity (blocking) across a wide wavelength spectrum.

![http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Atmospheric\_electromagnetic\_opacity.svg/2000px-Atmospheric\_electromagnetic\_opacity.svg.png]

**Figure 5 - Atmospheric Opacity vs. Wavelength**

The opposite of opacity is transmission. The earth's atmosphere absorbs, 
reflects, refracts, or allows electromagnetic radiation transmission. Suspended 
particles such as dust and raindrops can reflect and refract radiation. Figure 6 
shows electromagnetic radiation transmission through the atmosphere across the 
visible and infrared wavelength spectrum (subset of the Figure 5 spectrum). Some 
radiation bands, including visible light and some infrared pass through the 
earth's atmosphere with little to no attenuation. Such "atmospheric windows" or 
"transmission windows" allow infrared remote sensing from standoff distances. 
The bottom scale of Figure 6 shows which molecules are primary absorbers at 
various infrared radiation wavelengths. The most important absorbers are water 
vapor (H~2~O), carbon dioxide (CO~2~), and ozone (O~3~). Flight testers should 
understand wavelengths, absorption, refraction and atmospheric windows when 
designing tests to evaluate sensors.
