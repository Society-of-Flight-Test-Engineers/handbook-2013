## Longitudinal & Lateral Center of Gravity Measurement

### Test set-up procedures for empty weight \(\mathrm{cg}\) determination {-}

1. Clean aircraft including any mud or water seepage.
1. Ensure all aircraft equipment in place.
1. Drain to only residual oil (for older aircraft that include only residual oil as part of empty weight calculations) or fill to full oil (newer aircraft include full oil for calculations).
1. Drain to residual fuel only.
1. Rig all equipment in a closed building to eliminate wind effects.
1. Calibrate scales.
1. Record tare (bias in scale readings, may be due to wheel chocks, jack stands, or other test equipment)
1. Place aircraft on scales and level according to manufacturer's specifications.
1. Measure longitudinal and lateral distances between scale centers and datum. NOTE: distances behind datum are positive, distances ahead of datum are negative.
1. Record each scale weight

### Calculating longitudinal center of gravity {-}

11. Subtract the tare from each scale reading to get the correct weight.
1. Multiply each scale's corrected weight by its distance to the datum. This product is the moment for each scale.
1. Sum the moments in step 12.
1. Sum the corrected weights.
1. Divide the total moment by the total weight,step 13/step 14, to obtain the distance from the datum to the \(\mathrm{cg}\). Some aircraft use this distance for all \(\mathrm{cg}\) references (typically presented in inches).
1. Other aircraft refer \(\mathrm{cg}\) location to a percent of the mean aerodynamic chord, \(\mathrm{MAC}\). In this case, subtract the distance between the datum and the leading edge of the \(\mathrm{MAC}\) from the distance in step 15.
1. Divide the distance in step 16 by the length of the \(\mathrm{MAC}\). This number is the fraction of the \(\mathrm{cg}\) location along the \(\mathrm{MAC}\).
1. To present the above fraction in terms of % \(\mathrm{MAC}\), multiply by 100.

\[\frac{420 \text{ in-lb}}{1946 \text{ lbs}} = 0.216 \text{ in (Right of Centerline)} \]

### Correcting empty weight \(\mathrm{cg}\) for changes in fuel, passengers, equipment or stores. {-}

1. Note aircraft empty weight & empty weight \(\mathrm{cg}\). Multiply these values to obtain the empty weight moment.
1. Note the weight and moment arm for each item added to or subtracted from the aircraft (items subtracted are listed as negative weights).
1. Multiply each item's weight and arm to determine its moment.
1. Sum each item's moment in step 3 with the aircraft empty weight moment.
1. Sum each item's weight with the aircraft empty weight.
1. Calculate the new \(\mathrm{cg}\), step 4/step 5.

**7.3 Vertical Center of Gravity Measurement**

** **

1\. Drain or block landing gear struts to keep distances *G*, *J*, and *V* constant.

2. Level the fuselage and measure the weight on the nose wheel (*F_o*).

3. Tilt the aircraft at various (*θ*) measure nose wheel weight (*F*).

The change in nose wheel force can be written as

 

 

 ![][07007]

 ![][07008]

 

4\. Plot (*F_o-F*) vs the term in

parenthesis.

5\. Slope of line equals term in brackets.

6\. Solve for *V* after measuring *B*, *C*, *G,*

and the slope.

• This method

applies to "gear

down" \(\mathrm{cg}\) .

• For "gear up" add the manufacturer\'s

prediction of the \(\mathrm{cg}\) shift to this result.

**7.4 Moment & Product of Inertia Measurement**

 

The moment of inertia about any axis of a body is the summation of the product of every element's mass and distance squared. Moments of inertia represent the resistance to rotational momentum changes.

 

 

![][07010] ![][07011]

 

 

 

 

 

Products of inertia are also calculated about any body axes. They represent the symmetry of mass distribution (comparing opposing quadrants).

 

 

 ![][07012]![][07013]

 

 

 

• Aircraft moments and products of inertia are calculated using body axes as the reference system.

 

• Careful

Documentation can yield

inertial

predictions

within about

![][07014] 1-5% of actual.

** **

** 7.4.1 Radius of Gyration**

\* *

• Dimensions of all *I* terms are \[slugs-*ft^2^*\].

• Aircraft moments & products of inertia are generally assumed to be constant.

• For moments of inertia, mathematically replace *I* with the product of total mass times some constant with the dimensions of square feet.

• This constant is called the "radius of gyration" (*k*)

• If all the mass were concentrated at this radius, it would have the same moment of inertia as the actual body.

 

 ![][07015]

 

**Aircraft moment of inertia summary**

I_zb~ is always the largest value*.*

*I_{yb}\> I_xb~* for fuselage-loaded aircraft

*I_{xb}\> I_yb\ ~*for wing-loaded aircraft.

• Vehicle mass distribution can be represented with concentrated "dumbbell" masses.

• The lines connecting the opposing dumbbells are the **principle axes**.

• When the principle axis lies along some line different from the body axis, the products of inertia are non-zero.

• If the orientation of the principle axes and the moments of inertia about theses axes are known, then the moments of inertia about any other axis system can be calculated.

** **

 

** 7.4.2 Parallel Axis Theorem Applications**

** **

Shows how to **determine modified moment of inertia** after some

component alterations. Example: Correct original aircraft roll inertia, *I_xb~*~,~ to a modified value that accounts for the addition of wingtip fuel tanks.

![][07017] 

 

 

• \Delta*I_x\ comp~* is composed of two components

![][07018] 

 

 

 

• *I_x\ comp~* is the moment of inertia of just the new component about an axis which is parallel to the aircraft axis in question (this axis should run through the component's \(\mathrm{cg}\))*.*

• *I_x\ comp~* can be determined analytically by summing the inertias of every mass element throughout the component (documented for simple shapes in various engineering handbooks).

• *I_x\ comp~* can be determined experimentally by "swinging," (sect'n 7.4.8).

• *I_x\ comp~* is usually much smaller than *m_comp~ r^2^* and can often be omitted.

• *m_comp~* is the component's mass

•  *r* is the distance from the axis in question to the component's \(\mathrm{cg}\).

 

Similarly, the parallel axis theorem shows how to **determine modified products of inertia** after some component alterations

![][07019] 

\* *

*x* and *z* are the distances from the component \(\mathrm{cg}\) to the reference axes.

 

Moments of inertia are calculated about a set of reference axes which all intersect at the reference \(\mathrm{cg}\). In general, however, the actual \(\mathrm{cg}\) does not lie exactly at this reference *cg.* The parallel axis theorem shows how to **correct the moment of inertia to the actual \(\mathrm{cg}\) axis***.* As an example, the rolling moment of inertia about the actual \(\mathrm{cg}\) (*I_xcg~*) is calculated from the reference *I_xb~* as follows.

![][07020] 

 

 

where *m* = total mass

*y* = lateral distance between \(\mathrm{cg}\) and aircraft x-axis.

*z* = vertical distance between \(\mathrm{cg}\) and aircraft x-axis.

 

 

**7.4.3 Measuring Roll Inertia, *I_xb~*** (spring oscillation method)

** **

1\. Balance aircraft on prism-like "knife edges" that support wooden

cradles that conform to aircraft shape.

2\. Attach springs (tension springs illustrated here) so they are parallel to

line *a* as shown.

6\. Record peak magnitude of each oscillation.

7\. Calculate ζ using transient peak ratio method (see "Motion Analy sis," Section 8 of this handbook).

8\. Calculate natural frequency as

9\. Measure the spring's stiffness (*K_o*)

 

10\. Calculate inertia about oscillation axis (*I_o*) as

 

 ![][07025]![][07026]![][07027]

11\. Use parallel axis theorem to correct *I_o* to a parallel axis passing through the *cg.*

12\. Springs, cradles and attachments hardware will change the moment of inertia. Sum their total into a combined "test equipment inertia" (\Delta*I_te~*) and subtract this from the above result.

 

Combining steps 10-12 gives the complete **moment of inertia equation**

 

![][07028] 

 

where *h* is the vertical distance between the \(\mathrm{cg}\) and axis of oscillation and *d* is the total distance between the \(\mathrm{cg}\) and the axis of oscillation (*d* = *h* in the illustrated roll inertia test setup).

** **

**If automatic recording is not available\...**

Accomplish steps 1-3 as described for automatic recording case.

4\. Use a stopwatch to time several oscillations and calculate *\omega_d* as before

5\. Measure the spring's rotational stiffness (*K_o*)

6\. Approximate inertia using the damped frequency using

 

7\. Use parallel axis theorem to correct *I_o* to a parallel axis

passing through the *cg.*

\* *

8*.* Correct for effects of test hardware moment of inertia (\Delta*I_te~*).

9\. To correct for errors in the *I_o* approximation, apply an \"additional mass correction\" (\Delta*I_am~*) which equates the flate plate area damping effect to additional inertia. This correction is detailed in ref. 7.5.3.

 

 

Combining steps 6-9 gives

1\. Balance aircraft on knife edges as shown.

 

2\. Attach spring perpendicular to line *a*. Only one spring is required since the aircraft \(\mathrm{cg}\) is off-center. Spring must be stiff enough to hold the aircraft in equilibrium as well as provide a restoring moment during oscillations.

** **

• Inclination of principle axis (*\epsilon*) is positive if it lies in the +*xz* plane as shown.

 

• *I_xz~* positive if *\epsilon* is positive.

![][07041] negligible, giving

and

![][07042] 

• If *\epsilon* (and therefore *I_xz\ ~*) is positive, then yawing to the right will

generate a left rolling moment.

 

• If *\epsilon* and *I_xz~* are negative, a right yaw will generate a *right* moment.

** Measuring Axis of Inclination and *I_xz\ ~*(continued)**

** **

1\. Determine *I_xz~* and *\epsilon* by repeating yaw experiment for different spring

angles (\delta). Use instrumentation to note for each \delta.

 

2 Graphically determine the angle \delta_o at which the restoring vector

produced by the springs completely counteracts the roll motion.

![][07047]4. Calculate the product of inertia using

 

5\. Calculate the inclination of the principle axis using

 

 ![][07048]

 

 

![][07049]Note: Since the *I_xz~* test objective is to interpolate to a condition where equals zero, only the ratio is necessary

and the absolute magnitudes of the accelerations are not reuired. In other words, the roll acceleration sensitivity can be increased to allow for easier measurement of the ratio.

 

**7.4.7 Guidelines for Spring Oscillation Method**

 

 

• Use only small magnitude oscillations

 

• Keep size and radius of knife edges as small as practical.

 

• Springs are typically linear except around zero load. Best results

occur if springs are pre-loaded.

 

• Choose spring stiffness so oscillation frequency will be within

instrumentation limits.

 

• If using a hand recorded stopwatch, best spring stiffness gives about one cycle per second (*f* = 1).

 

∗ Estimate the desired spring rate using

 

 ![][07050]

 

 

 

• The purpose of instrumentation is to provide a means for measuring frequency and magnitude. Any of several parameters will be sufficient, including angular displacement, rate or acceleration; or linear acceleration.

** 7.4.8 Swing Method**

** **

1\. Suspend component as shown.

![][07051] 

2\. Measure pendulum length (*l*), component mass (*m ),* and the period of oscillation (*T*).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

![][07052]• The observed period is a function of the effective pendulum length.

![][07053] and

or

![][07054]

 

 

 

• This effective length is the total radius of gyration *l_eff~* = *K_tot\ ~*

 

• The total moment of inertia about the pivot point is the product of mass and radius of gyration squared. The parallel axis theorem states that this also is the sum of the component's moment of inertia about its \(\mathrm{cg}\) plus its mass times the distance between the pivot and the component's \(\mathrm{cg}\).

 

 ![][07055]

 

3\. Solving for the component's moment of inertia about its own \(\mathrm{cg}\) gives
