# Pitot Statics

*Editor's Note*

*In an effort to reduce confusion and conflict regarding pitot and static pressure nomenclature, SFTE has elected to change two definitions and symbols since the first edition of this handbook was released. Henceforth, \(\Delta Ps\) shall indicate static pressure ERROR (\(\Delta P_s = P_s - P_a)\) and \(\Delta P_T\) shall indicate total (i.e. pitot) pressure ERROR (\(\Delta P_T = P_p - P_T\)). This nomenclature eliminates the \(\Delta P_p\) symbol and confusion as to whether it indicates position error or pitot error.*

## Subsonic Airspeed and Mach Equation

True Airspeed

\[V_{T} = \left\lbrack \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma-1} \frac{P_a}{\rho_a} \left( \left\lbrack \frac{P_T - P_a}{P_a} + 1 \right\rbrack^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma} - 1 \right) \right\rbrack ^{1/2}\]

Equivalent Airspeed

(= \(V_T\) equation with assumption of std day sea level density)

\[V_{e} = \sqrt{7\frac{P_{a}}{\rho_0}\left( \left\lbrack \frac{P_{T} - P_{a}}{P_{a}} + 1 \right\rbrack^{\frac{2}{7}} - 1 \right)} = V_{T}\sqrt{\frac{\rho_{a}}{\rho_0}} = V_{T}\sqrt{\sigma}\]

Calibrated Airspeed

(= \(V_e\) equation with assumption of std day sea level pressure)

\[V_{c} = \left\lbrack \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1}\frac{P_0}{\rho_0}\left( \left\lbrack \frac{P_{T} - P_{a}}{P_0} + 1 \right\rbrack^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right) \right\rbrack^{\frac{1}{2}}\]


\[\sqrt{7 \frac{P_0}{\rho_0}\left( \left\lbrack \frac{q_c}{P_0} + 1 \right\rbrack^{0.2857} - 1 \right)}\]

Applying British units (\(lb/ft^2\)) and converting from *ft/sec* to knots yields

\[ V_{c} = 1479\sqrt{\left\lbrack \frac{P_{T} - P_{a}}{2116} + 1 \right\rbrack^{\frac{2}{7}} - 1} ~(kts)\]

Mach Number

\[M = \frac{V_{T}}{a} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\gamma - 1}\left\lbrack \left( \frac{P_{T} - P_{a}}{P_{a}} + 1 \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right\rbrack} = \sqrt{5\left( \left\lbrack \frac{q_{c}}{P_{a}} + 1 \right\rbrack^{\frac{2}{7}} - 1 \right)}\]


## Scale Altitude (Compressibility ) Correction

The name comes from the fact that although the equivalent airspeed equation does correct for compressibility, the sea level pressure assumption used for calibrated airspeed makes the compressibility correction valid only for that (sea level) pressure. Above sea level, the calibrated airspeed must be re-scaled for pressure effects on compressibility. The mathematical method for determining \(V_e\) from \(V_c\) is to first solve the calibrated airspeed equation for \(q_c\).

\[q_c = P_0  \left\lbrack \left( \frac{\rho_0}{P_0} \frac{V_c^2}{7} + 1 \right)^{3.5} - 1 \right\rbrack\]

Next, substitute this value and the ambient pressure (\(P_a\)) into the equivalent airspeed equation. (\(q_c = P_T - P_a\))

\[V_e = \sqrt{7 \frac{P_a}{\rho_0} \left( \left\lbrack \frac{q_c}{P_a}+1 \right\rbrack^{2/7} - 1 \right) } \]

The adjacent chart does this graphically for all subsonic airspeeds.

\[V_e = V_c + \Delta V_c\]

![][04003]


## Subsonic Relations Between Compressible and Incompressible Dynamic Pressure

For constant density (incompressible) flow Bernoulli's equation reduces to

\[V_T = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\rho_a}(P_T - P_a)} = \sqrt{\frac{2q}{\rho_a}} \]

Where incompressible dynamic pressure \(q\) is defined as \(P_T-P_a\).

As airflow speed increases, its density at the stagnation point increases thereby increasing the sensed pressure. The ratio between compressible & incompressible dynamic pressure can be written as a function of Mach number

\[q_c = q \left\lbrack 1 + \frac{M^2}{4} + \frac{M^4}{40} + \frac{M^6}{1600} + ... \right\rbrack \]

True dynamic pressure \(q\) (as used in modeling) is defined in dimensional analysis as:

\[q = \frac{1}{2} \rho_a V_T^2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho_0V_e^2\]

This value for \(q\) should not be confused with compressible (a.k.a. impact or differential) pressure, \(q_c (= P_T - P_a) \)

![][04008]


## Supersonic Airspeed and Mach Equations

\(P_T'\) denotes pitot pressure behind shock wave

True Airspeed

\[ \frac{P_T' - P_a}{P_a} = \frac{q_c}{P_a} = \left[ \frac{\gamma + 1}{2} \left(  \frac{V}{a} \right)^2  \right]^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \left[ \frac{1}{ \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1} \left( \frac{V}{a} \right)^2 - \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1} }  \right]^\frac{1}{\gamma-1} - 1 \]

Equivalent Airspeed (valid if \(q_c/P_a > 0.892 929 158 \))

\[ \frac{q_c}{P_a} = \frac{166.92 \left[ \frac{V_e}{a_0 \sqrt{\sigma}} \right]^7} {\left( 7 \left[ \frac{V_e}{a_0 \sqrt{\sigma}} \right]^2 - 1 \right)^{2.5}} - 1 \]

Calibrated Airspeed (valid if \(V_c > a_0 \))

\[ \frac{q_c}{P_0} = \frac{166.92 \left[ \frac{V_c}{a_0} \right]^7} {\left( 7 \left[ \frac{V_c}{a_0} \right]^2 - 1 \right)^{2.5}} - 1\]

Mach Number

\[ \frac{q_c}{P_a} = \frac{166.92 M^7} {\left( 7 M^2 - 1 \right)^{2.5}} -1 \]


## Total Temperature Equation

Since stagnation exists at the probe, it absorbs the energy of the air

![][04013]

Apply Bernoulli:

\[ \frac{V^2}{2} + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}  \frac{P_s}{\rho_s} = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \frac{P_p}{\rho_p} \]

Also \(\frac{P}{\rho} = RT \) and \(a^2 = \gamma RT \) therefore

\[ \frac{T_T}{T_a} = 1 + \left[ \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} \right] M^2 \]

Use *K* (probe recovery factor) to account for heat losses:

\[ \frac{T_T}{T_a} = 1 + \left[ \frac{K(\gamma - 1)}{2} \right] M^2 \]

During position error flight testing, measure \(T_i\).  From \(V_c\) and \(H_{\mathrm{pc}}\) determine M

\[ T_i + \Delta T_{\mathrm{ic}} = T_T = T_a + T_aKM^2 \]

Plot \(T_i\) vs \(M^2\)

![][04014]


## Altimeter Equation

\(P_a = P_0 \left(1-6.875 35 \times 10^{-6} H\right)^{5.256}\) below 36,089 ft

\(P_a = P_0 \left(0.223 35 \right) \textrm{e}^{-0.000 048 06[H-36089]}\) above 36,089 ft

## Position Error Test Methods

### Fly-by

As depicted below, the flyby method originally used some sort of viewing platform with surveyed distances and a grid or other device for determining the aircraft's relative angle above the platform's altimeter. This information combined to give the aircraft's actual pressure altitude. Modern methods replace the tower system with a radar altimeter or GPS unit to determine tapeline height above the flyby line (\(H_g\)). This geometric height is converted to a pressure altitude change using a temperature correction. When added to the aircraft's pressure altitude on the runway, this change provides the actual pressure altitude during the flyby (\(\textrm{Actual } H_c = \textrm{runway pressure altitude} + H_g (T_s/T_t)\)). <!--- This nomenclature is inconsistent with the rest of the section --->

![][04017]

\[\text{Actual } H_{c} = H_{c_{\mathrm{tower}}} + \left( D\tan\theta \cdot \frac{T_{s}}{T_{t}} \right) \]

\[ \Delta H_{\mathrm{pc}} = \text{Actual } H_c - \left( H_i + \Delta H_{\mathrm{ic}} \right) \]

<!--- Changing capital subscript 's' to lower-case to make more consistent with rest of the handbook --->
\[ \Delta P_s = \rho g \Delta H_{\mathrm{pc}} \]

\[ \Delta P_{S} = q_{c} - q_{\mathrm{cic}} \]

\[ \Delta P_{S} = \frac{1}{2}\rho_{0}{V_{c}^{2} - \frac{1}{2}\rho_{0}{V_{\mathrm{ic}}}^{2} \text{ (low Mach only)}} \]

Solve for \(V_c\)

\[ \Delta V_{\mathrm{pc}} = V_c - V_{\mathrm{ic}} \]

<!--- FIXME: What flow chart is this referring to??? --->
See flowchart for high mach or \(P_T \ne 0\) cases.

![][04018]

Note: A check on basic instrument calibration is easily accomplished using a "ground block" where a parked test aircraft compares altimeters with tower. Any error can be treated as a bias.

This altitude-based test method determines altimeter corrections and therefore static error directly. Accurately converting this static source error to an airspeed correction also requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (\(\Delta P_T\) ).  This can be determined either through direct comparison with a calibrated noseboom pitot pressure or from one of the airspeed-based methods that directly yield airspeed corrections (pace, ground course, GPS). In lieu of these options, the pitot error may assumed to be zero, but this will reduce confidence in the calculated value for airspeed correction.

### Ground Course Method

<!--- This figure doesn't add much value --->
![][04019]

Fly known course at constant \(V_i\)

Elapsed time = \(\Delta T\), therefore \(V_T = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta T} \)

Use \(H_i\) and \(T_i\) to compute \(V_e = V_T \left(\sqrt{\sigma} \right) = V_c\) for low altitude

Correct \(V_i\) for instrument error corrections (\(\Delta V_{\mathrm{ic}} \)) using

\[V_{\mathrm{ic}} = V_i + \Delta V_{\mathrm{ic}} \]

\[\Delta V_{\mathrm{pc}} = V_c - V_{\mathrm{ic}} \]

To determine altimeter error assume \(\Delta P_T = 0\)

\[\frac{1}{2} \rho_0 \left[ V_c^2 - V_{\mathrm{ic}}^2 \right] = +\Delta P_s \]

\[\Delta P_s = +\rho g \Delta H \]

If \(\Delta P_T \ne 0\), then \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{pc}} = + \frac{\Delta P_s - \Delta P_T}{\rho g} \)

<!--- FIXME: This is a poor place to label a figure --->
Error resulting from a \(\frac{1}{2}\) sec timing error

![][04021]

This airspeed-based test method determines airspeed corrections directly. Accurately converting this airspeed error to a static source error requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (\(\Delta P_T\)). This can be determined using one of the altitude-based methods that directly yield altitude corrections (tower fly-by, trailing cone or bomb). In lieu of these options, the pitot error may assumed to be zero, but this will reduce confidence in the calculated values for static pressure error and altimeter correction.


### Trailing Cone/Bomb Method

![][04023]

1. Measure \(P_s\) (ref) away from pressure field of aircraft
2. Cone is used to stabilize static line
3. No speed limitations
4. Inexpensive---can be trailed on landing
5. Consider lag effects during rapid altitude changes

\(\Delta P_s = \Delta P_{s_{\mathrm{A/C}}} - \Delta P_{s_{\mathrm{REF}}} \)

\(\Delta H_{\mathrm{pc}} = +\frac{\Delta P_s}{\rho g} = \textrm{altimeter correction} \)  <!--- Probably not needed to define this here again --->

\(\Delta P_T - \Delta P_s = \Delta P_D = q_{\mathrm{ic}} - q_c \text{ assuming } \Delta P_T = 0 \text{ , } M < 0.2 \)  <!--- Unclear --->

If pitot errors do exist, then they must be included in calculations for \(\Delta V_{\mathrm{pc}}\) (see flowchart). <!--- which one??? --->

Using a trailing cone during stall testing may give airspeed errors due to lag errors during the deceleration.

This altitude-based test method determines altimeter corrections and therefore static error directly. Accurately converting this static source error to an airspeed correction also requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (\(\Delta P_T\)). This can be determined either through direct comparison with a calibrated noseboom pitot pressure or from one of the airspeed-based methods that directly yield airspeed corrections (pace, ground course, GPS). In lieu of these options, the pitot error may assumed to be zero, but this will reduce confidence in the calculated value for airspeed correction.

### GPS Methods
<!--- FIXME: This whole subsection needs to be reworked to make more consistent with the rest of the Section and handbook.  Particularly formatting and use of unordered lists to introduce each chapter --->

<!--- The following list should probably be turned into a paragraph rather than a bullet list --->
The attraction

  * no aircraft modifcations required
    * no trailing cone or aircraft plumbing mod
    * no flight test boom
  * no limitation on speed or altitude
    * can be done down to near stall
    * any altitude
  * easy data reduction
    * no correlation with pace aircraft, ground radar, or other references required

Various methods available, all assume **steady** winds and ambient temperature. You must determine wind speed and direction to calculate \(V_T\) and \(T_0\) and to ensure steady winds existed during test series.

GPS accuracies are variable. Know tolerances before accepting GPS as a truth model.

If exact (\(\pm 10^{\circ}\)) winds are calculated inflight, you can fly one pass directly into/away from the wind

\[V_T = V_G + V_{Headwind}\]

This airspeed-based test method determines airspeed corrections directly. Accurately converting this airspeed error to a static source error requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (\(\Delta P_T\)). This can be determined using one of the altitude-based methods that directly yield altitude corrections (tower fly-by, trailing cone or bomb). In lieu of these options, the pitot error may assumed to be zero, but this will reduce confidence in the calculated values for static pressure error and altimeter correction.

<!--- FIXME: set up cross-reference to Section 4.11 and the "last chart on Page 04-29" below.  Also there is no Page 04-29 in the handbook--->
*Graphs in Section 4.11 separately show the effect of measurement errors in \(\Delta P_T\), air temperature, or true airspeed on \(\Delta V_c\) calculations . The last chart of this Section shows how each knot of accumulated \(\Delta V_c\) uncertainty affects the \(\Delta H_c\) uncertainty at various altitudes and temperatures.*

Flying four legs instead of three allows four separate calculations of wind speed & direction to confirm stable winds at that test airspeed. If several real-time calculations of winds confirm constant direction and velocity, then testing may be shortened by flying only one pass directly into or away from the wind. If this is done, an end-of-test wind calibration must be performed to confirm steady winds throughout the test series. To minimize temperature and wind variations, testing should be accomplished within a relatively small area.

#### Horseshoe Track GPS Method {-}

  * Horseshoe track method
    * fly three legs with each perpedicular ground tracks, noting GPS ground speed on each
    * determine true airspeed by solving three equations in three unknowns
  * Practical problem

True airspeed: \(V_T = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2 + V_1^2 \times \frac{V_3^2}{V_2^2}}\)

Wind velocity: \(V_W = \sqrt{\left( \frac{V_1 - V_3}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{V_2 - V_1 \times V_3 / V_2}{2} \right) ^2 } \)

Wind direction: \(\psi_W = \tan^{-1} \frac{V_2 - V_1 \times V_3 / V_2}{V_1 - V_3} \)

#### Horseshoe Heading GPS Method {-}

  * Horseshoe Heading Method
    * Fly three legs with perpendicular headings, noting GPS ground speed on each
    * Determine true airspeed by solving three equations in three unknowns

![][04031]

<!--- FIXME: the wind direction (psi) below doesn't use the "W" subscript as it did above.  Intentional? --->
Wind direction: \(\psi = \tan^{-1} \frac{-V_{G1}^2 + 2V_{G2}^2 - V_{G3}^2}{V_{G3}^2 - V_{G1}^2} \)

Wind velocity: \(V_W = \frac{1}{2} \left[ V_{G3}^2 + V_{G1}^2 \pm \sqrt{ \left(V_{G3}^2 + V_{G1}^2 \right)^2 \pm \left( \frac{-V_{G1}^2 + 2V_{G2}^2 - V_{G3}^2}{\sin{\psi}} \right)^2 } \right]^{1/2} \)

True airspeed: \(V_T = \sqrt{\frac{V_{G3}^2 + V_{G1}^2}{2} - V_W^2} \)

The "Windbox" method consists of flying four legs instead of three. The extra leg provides a fourfold increase in wind calculations to improve result confidence. The "Orbis" method extends this advantage by collecting data at every heading throughout a level turn.

#### Cloverleaf Method {-}

(Microsoft Excel spreadsheet adapted from Doug Gray, NSW Australia)

  * Fly three legs with approximately 90-120 degree difference between headings.
    * Can be accomplished in a broad turn as with the horseshoe method, or
    * Directly over a single point (cloverleaf maneuver).
  * Accurate results require
    * Identical values for indicated airspeed (and TAS) for all legs.
    * Constant winds throughout data collection (single W/S vector in figure).
    * Approx. 10 seconds stable ground speed, Vg, (G/S in figure) during each leg.
  * Aircraft heading results for each leg entail an airborne compass swing.

<!--- FIXME: The following is mean to represent Excel spreadsheet formulas, but they either need to copy-and-pastable for Excel, or the basic formulas consistent with the rest of the Handbook should be presented --->

| \(Trk_{1}\)    \(Trk_{2}\)    \(Trk_{3}\)  |

|:-----------------------|
| \(X_1 = V_{g_1} * \sin(\pi * (360 - Trk_1) / 180) \) |
| \(Y_1 = V_{g_1} * \cos(\pi * (360 - Trk_1) / 180) \) |
| \(X_2 = V_{g_2} * \sin(\pi * (360 - Trk_2) / 180) \) |
| \(Y_2 = V_{g_2} * \cos(\pi * (360 - Trk_2) / 180) \) |
| \(X_3 = V_{g_3} * \sin(\pi * (360 - Trk_3) / 180) \) |
| \(Y_3 = V_{g_3} * \cos(\pi * (360 - Trk_3) / 180) \) |
| \(M_1 = -(X_2 - X_1) / (Y_2 - Y_1) \) |
| \(M_2 = -(X_3 - X_1) / (Y_3 - Y_1) \) |
| \(B_1 = (Y_1 + Y_2)/2 - M_1 * (X_1 + X_2) / 2 \) |
| \(B_2 = (Y_1 + Y_3)/2 - M_2 * (X_1 + X_3) / 2 \) |
| \(V_{W_x} = (B_1 - B_2) / (M_2 - M_1) \) |
| \(V_{w_y} = M_1 * V_{W_x} + B_1 \) |
