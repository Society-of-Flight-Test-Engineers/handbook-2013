Although individual organizations generally are consistent in-house, confusion often arises when trying to mathematically translate inputs &amp; deflections from one organization to another. This section documents the generally accepted “body axes” sign conventions then discusses the rationale for several viewpoints addressing the “inputs &amp; deflections” debate. Below is the SFTE sign convention. Wind Axes Sign Convention Winds are listed according to the direction they are coming from. Airports refer winds to magnetic North while winds at altitude are typically referred to true North. Headwind is true airspeed minus ground speed. (Vw=VT-Vg). Body Axes Sign Convention The generally accepted body axes sign convention is based on the establishment of a three-dimensional axis system with the following properties: 1. It is right-handed orthogonal 2. Its origin is at the vehicle's reference center of gravity (defined by builder). 3. The axis system moves with the airframe. Translational displacements, rates, accelerations, &amp; forces are positive along the positive body axes directions. In spite of the simplicity of this logic, it is important to recognize that lift and normal load factor are positive in the negative z direction and the drag is positive in the negative x direction. Angular displacements, rates, accelerations &amp; moments, are positive according to the “right hand rule” (a clockwise rotation while looking in the direction of the positive axis) as shown in the figure. The body axes, forces &amp; translations along them, and moments &amp; rotations about them are shown with arrows indicating the positive direction. Angular displacements, rates, accelerations &amp; moments, are positive according to the “right hand rule” (a clockwise rotation while looking in the direction of the positive axis) as shown in the figure. The body axes, forces &amp; translations along them, and moments &amp; rotations about them are shown with arrows indicating the positive direction. Angle of attack is positive clockwise from the projection of the velocity vector on the xz plane to the reference x body axis. The angle of sideslip is positive clockwise from the xz plane to the velocity vector (wind in the pilot’s right ear). Aircraft true heading is the angle between true North and the projection of the x-body axis onto the horizontal plane. Mag. heading refers to mag North The velocity vector is measured relative to the air mass while the flightpath is measured relative to the ground. They are equivalent only when winds are zero. Flightpath heading angle (ground track heading) σg, is the horizontal angle between true North and the projection of the flightpath on the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is from north to east. € Flightpath elevation angle; γ, is the vertical angle between the flightpath and the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is up. During a descent, this parameter is commonly known as glide path angle. Flightpath bank angle; \\(\\mu\\), is the angle between the plane formed by the velocity vector and the lift vector and the vertical plane containing the velocity vector. Positive rotation is clockwise about the velocity vector, looking forward. Fuselage reference station (FRS), Water line (WL), and Buttock line (BL) are reference coordinates established by the design group.

From the body axis convention above, flight testers recognize that a climbing right turn generates positive angular measurements. Logically then, pull, right roll and right yaw pilot inputs and subsequent surface deflections should also be positive. The traditional flight tester’s convention follows as “All input forces &amp; displacements, surface deflections, and motions that cause a climbing right turn are positive.” Due to differential nature of aileron deflections, they require more discussion. The flight tester’s logic implies (but does not dictate) positive deflections are right aileron up and left aileron down. It is, however, equally acceptable to assign downward (or upward) deflection as positive for both ailerons and calculate the difference between the two as a measure of rolling moment. The rationale within the wind tunnel community is also logical: any control surface deflection that increases lift is positive. From this, positive deflections are trailing edge down (TED) for each: trailing edge flap, stabilizer, elevator, stabilator, rollervator, ruddervator, canard, aileron, flaperon, and all their tabs. Leading edge flap down is also positive. Similarly, since side force is positive to the right, then positive rudder and rudder tab deflections are trailing left (TEL). The only exception to this straightforward logic is for spoilers and speed brakes that extend only in one direction: this deflection is positive even though it might decrease the lift. Since the above rationale defines downward deflection as positive for both ailerons, a measurement of rolling moments requires calculation of the differential aileron deflection. This rationale does not, however, specifically dictate whether a “positive” differential deflection should generate right wing down (RWD) or left wing down (LWD) moments. Differential aileron can be calculated as either. $_{a} = ) or \\(\\delta_{a} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\text{aL}} - \\delta_{\\text{aR}}}{2}\\) Selection of the RWD convention is obvious from the flight tester’s viewpoint since deflections that generate right rolls are positive. An alternative interpretation is that a positive differential aileron deflection is one that lifts the positive (right) wing lifts more than the left (LWD). Another common convention for ailerons is one that gives the same sign to both ailerons for any input. The “right hand screw” convention is opposite to the flight tester’s convention, but may be more common: δaR = +TED, δaL = +TEU. The above wind tunnel rationale dictates only the polarity for individual control surface deflections, and leaves open the sign convention debate about controller (inceptor) input forces &amp; displacements. One approach is that positive inputs should generate positive motions while an alternate approach is that positive inputs generate positive surface deflections. Only the flight tester’s convention states that positive inputs yield positive motions and deflections. All approaches are mathematically connected to the hinge moment sign convention discussed below. The simplest control surface hinge moment convention is that all positive hinge moments (generated by the pilot and the aerodynamics) move the surface in a positive direction, i.e., positive input forces yield positive deflections. This has different implications for the different sign conventions: • According to the above flight tester’s sign convention, a positive pull force is required to generate a positive (TEU) elevator deflection (positive stick force generates a climb). • According to wind tunnel sign convention, a positive push force is required to generate a positive (TED) elevator deflection (positive stick force generates a dive). The alternate viewpoint defines a positive inceptor hinge moment as one that opposes the aerodynamic moments. In other words, a positive inceptor hinge moment moves the surface to a position which generates positive aerodynamic hinge moments or “positive input forces &amp; displacements generate negative surface deflections.” Based on the above background, the SFTE technical council proposes the following standard convention for inceptor &amp; surface forces &amp; deflections: • Due to its widespread use and its simple &amp; robust nature, use the wind tunnel convention for control surface deflections. • Due to widespread test pilot &amp; FTE familiarity and logical nature, use the flight tester’s convention that positive inceptor forces &amp; displacements generate a climbing right turn. • A fallout from these conventions is that positive inceptor hinge moments generate positive aerodynamic hinge moments (negative surface deflections). • Consistent use of the above logic requires that the calculated value for aileron deflection be negative for right wing down moments. Similarly, differential ruddervator deflections generating nose right yawing moments should have negative values.

Historically, Dutch, U.S. and some British aircraft use a climbing right turn, while it is a diving left turn for Canadian, Australian, and some British aircraft. The SFTE Technical Council recognizes that several combinations of the above possibilities are currently in use around the world, and invites comments, additions, or corrections to the above summary and proposal. Although SFTE does not expect all organizations to adopt this standard, it still provides a cornerstone for reference purposes 1.7 Thermodynamics Relations (references 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6) 1.7.1 Thermodynamic Definitions A Process is an event with a redistribution of energy within a system. A Reversible process is one that can be reversed such that the system returns to its original state (form, location &amp; amount). An Irreversible process cannot return to its original state due to heat flow from higher to lower temperatures, fluid turbulence, friction, or inelastic deformation. The change in entropy is non-zero. An Isothermal process is one in which the temperature of the fluid is constant. An Adiabatic process is one in which heat is not transferred to or from the fluid. Work is the energy transfer by way of changing mechanical energy. Heat is the energy transfer from one body to another by virtue of a temperature difference between them. An Isentropic process has constant entropy. Conduction is the energy transfer from a warmer body by tangible contact (transfer of some internal molecular kinetic energy). Convection is the repositioning the energy of a fluid without state changes or energy transformations (e.g. heated air moving from one room to another room). Radiation is the energy transmission through space. 1.7.2 Thermodynamic Symbols Symbol Use \\(A\\) area \\(C\\) compressibility factor \\(c\\) speed of sound \\(E = u\\) specific internal energy (e.g. Btu/lb) \\(H\\) specific enthalpy (e.g. Btu/lb) \\(J\\) Joule \\(Q\\) energy supplied to a system or region as heat (e.g. Btu/lb) \\(P\\) absolute pressure (e.g. lbs/ft2) \\(V\\) specific volume (e.g. ft3/lb) \\(W\\) work (+ if entering) \\(\\overline{V}\\) velocity \\(\\Delta\\) change ( final - initial value) \\(Z\\) altitude \\(S\\) specific entropy \\(R\\) gas constant for each gas (for air = 287 J/kg/K = 53.35 ft-lb/lbmR) \\(\\overline{R}\\) universal gas constant = 8.314 kJ/kmol/K = 1545 ft lb/lbmol/R \\(M\\) molar mass (for air = 28.97 kg/kmol) \\(N\\) number of moles \\(\\rho\\) density 1.7.3 Thermodynamic Laws The First Law of Thermodynamics shows that the net amount of energy added to a system equals the net change in energy within the system (Principle of Conservation of Energy): \\(W + Q = (E_2 - E_1)\\) The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy increases during any irreversible process: \\(S_2 &gt; S_1\\) Ideal Gas Equation of State (a.k.a.

That is, for any matrix \\[*A*\\]: \\[*I*\\]\\[*A*\\] = \\[*A*\\]\\[*I*\\] = \\[*A*\\] The identity \\[*I*\\] is a square matrix consisting of ones on the principle diagonal and zeros everywhere else; i.e.: a ⋅ α^{-1} = α^{1-1} = α^{0} = 1 In the same way, the matrix \\[*A*\\]^{-1} is called the inverse matrix of \\[*A*\\] since: \\[*A*\\]\\[*A*\\]^{-1} = \\[*A*\\]^{-1} \\[*A*\\] = \\[*A*\\]^{0} = \\[*I*\\] Cofactors and Determinates The signed minor, with the sign determined by the sum of the row and column, is called the cofactor of aij and is denoted by: Aij = (−1)i+j Μij The value of the determinant is equal to the sum of the products of the elements of any single row or column and their respective cofactors. Arbitrarily expanding about the first row of a 3 x 3 matrix gives the determinant: |A| = a11A11 + a12A12 + a13A13 = which expands to give the final solution: |A| = a11(a22 a33 − a23 a32) − a12(a21 a33 − a23 a31) + a13(a21 a32 − a22 a31) There is a straightforward four-step method for computing the inverse of a given matrix \\[*A*\\]: Step 1 Compute the determinant of \\[*A*\\]. This determinant is written |A|. If the determinant is zero or does not exist, the matrix \\[*A*\\] is defined as singular and an inverse cannot be found. Step 2 Transpose matrix \\[*A*\\]. The resultant matrix is written \\[*A*\\]^T . Step 3 Replace each element aij of the transposed matrix by its cofactor Aij. This resulting matrix is defined as the adjoint of matrix \\[*A*\\] and is written Adj\\[*A*\\]. Step 4 Divide the adjoint matrix by the scalar value of the determinant of \\[*A*\\] which was computed in Step 1. The resulting matrix is the inverse and is written \\[*A*\\]^{-1} . Example: Given the following set of simultaneous equations, solve for x1, x2, and x3. 3x1 + 2x2 − 2x3 = y1 − x1 + x2 + 4x3 = y2 2x1 − 3x2 + 4x3 = y3 This set of equations can be written as: \\[*A*\\] \\[*x*\\] = \\[*y*\\] and solved as follows: \\[*x*\\] = \\[*A*\\]^{-1} \\[*y*\\] Thus, the system can be solved for the values of x1, x2, and x3 by computing the inverse of \\[*A*\\]. Step 1. Compute the determinant of \\[*A*\\]. Expanding about the first row |A| = 3(4 + 12) − 2 (−4 −8) −2 (3 − 2) |A| = 48 + 24 −2 = 70 Step 2. Transpose \\[*A*\\]. Step 3. Determine the adjoint matrix by replacing each element in \\[*A*\\]^T by its Cofactor. Step 4. Divide by the scalar value of the determinant of \\[*A*\\] which was computed as 70 in Step 1. if y1 = 1, y2 = 13, and y3 = 8 Cramer’s Rule Given matrices A{x} = {b} If the det (D) of a matrix (A) exists, and Dr is the det of the matrix obtained from A by replacing the rth column of A by the column {b}, then the solution to (1) is xr = Dr/D r = 1,2,…,n Example of Cramer’s Rule 2.5 Vector Algebra (reference 2.5) 2.5.1 Addition Given vectors \\(\\bar{A}\\) and \\(\\bar{B}\\), where the \\(i\\)th component of \\(\\bar{A}\\) is given by \\(a_i\\), we define addition \\(\\bar{A} + \\bar{B}\\) component-wise, such that the \\(i\\)th component of \\(\\bar{A} + \\bar{B}\\) is given by \\(a_i + b_i\\). 2.5.2 Subtraction We define vector subtraction just as we defined vector addition above. 2.5.3 Scalar Multiplication Given a real number, \\(m\\), and vectors \\(\\bar{A}\\) and \\(\\bar{B}\\), where the ith component of \\(\\bar{A}\\) is given by \\(a_i\\), we define scalar multiplication \\(m \\bar{A}\\) component-wise, such that the ith component of \\(m \\bar{A}\\) is given by \\(m a_i\\). When \\(m\\) and \\(a+i\\) are real numbers, the usual properties apply: Commutative \\(m \\bar{A} = \\bar{A} m\\). Associative \\(m (n \\bar{A}) = (mn) \\bar{A}\\). Distributive \\((m + n) \\bar{A} = m \\bar{A} + n \\bar{A}\\). When \\(a+i\\) are real numbers, we have the following properties that apply to vectors: Commutative \\(\\bar{A} + \\bar{B} = \\bar{B} + \\bar{A}\\). Associative \\(\\bar{A} + (\\bar{B} + \\bar{C}) = (\\bar{A} + \\bar{B}) + \\bar{C}\\). Distributive \\(m (\\bar{A} + \\bar{B}) = m \\bar{A} + m \\bar{B}\\). 2.5.4 Dot Product Given vectors \\(\\bar{A}\\) and \\(\\bar{B}\\), where the \\(i\\)th component of \\(\\bar{A}\\) is given by \\(a_i\\) and the vectors have the same dimension, \\(n\\), we define the dot product \\(\\bar{A} \\cdot \\bar{B}\\) as follows: \\[\\bar{A} \\cdot \\bar{B} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i b_i .\\] For example, given three-dimensional vectors, we have: \\[\\bar{A} \\cdot \\bar{B} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 .\\] The terms dot product, scalar product, and inner product usually mean the same thing. 2.5.5 Norm The norm or vector norm, denoted \\[ \\left| \\bar{A} \\right|,\\] is the magnitude of the vector. We compute it thus: \\[ \\left| \\bar{A} \\right| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2} .\\]. For example, given a three-dimensional vector in the \\(xyz\\) plane, we have: \\[ \\left| \\bar{A} \\right| = \\sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2} .\\] The two types of notation, \\(| \\bar{A} |\\) and \\(||\\bar{A}||\\) are equivalent. With this additional notation, we can also define the dot product this way: \\[\\bar{A} \\cdot \\bar{B} = \\left| \\bar{A} \\right| \\left| \\bar{B} \\right| \\cos{\\theta} ,\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the vectors. 2.5.6 Vector Cross Product The cross product is an operation on vectors in three dimensional space denoted \\(\\bar{A} \\times \\bar{B} .\\) We can define it in terms of matrix determinants in the following way. \\[ \\bar{A} \\times \\bar{B} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{i} &amp; \\hat{j} &amp; \\hat{k}\\\\ a_x &amp; a_y &amp; a_z\\\\ b_x &amp; b_y &amp; b_z \\end{vmatrix} .\\] Expanding this expression gives us: \\[ \\bar{A} \\times \\bar{B} = \\begin{vmatrix} a_y &amp; a_z\\\\ b_y &amp; b_z \\end{vmatrix} \\hat{i} + \\begin{vmatrix} a_x &amp; a_z\\\\ b_x &amp; b_z \\end{vmatrix} \\hat{j} + \\begin{vmatrix} a_x &amp; a_y\\\\ b_x &amp; b_y \\end{vmatrix} \\hat{k} .\\] 2.5.7 Vector Differentiation Let \\(\\vec{r}(t)\\) be a vector-valued function, denoted in this way: \\(\\vec{r}(t) = (x(t),y(t))\\), which is an example of a function that returns a position vector. A similar and equivalent notation is as follows: \\(\\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\\hat{i} + y(t)\\hat{j}\\). The first derivative of \\(\\vec{r}(t)\\) with respect to time, \\(t\\), is a vector-valued function that denotes velocity. This function returns a vector tangential to the trajectory with a magnitude equal to the speed of the particle. The second derivative of \\(\\vec{r}(t)\\) with respect to time, \\(t\\), is a vector-valued function that denotes acceleration. This function returns a vector tangential to the velocity vector with a magnitude equal to the acceleration of the particle. With this notation, the normal differenation operations hold for vector-valued functions along with the following. Derivative of a Sum \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\vec{r}(t) + \\vec{s}(t) \\right) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{r}(t) + \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{s}(t).\\] Derivative of a Dot Product \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\vec{r}(t) \\cdot \\vec{s}(t) \\right) = \\vec{r}(t) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{s}(t) + \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{r}(t) \\cdot \\vec{s}(t).\\] Derivative of a Cross Product \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\vec{r}(t) \\times \\vec{s}(t) \\right) = \\vec{r}(t) \\times \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{s}(t) + \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{r}(t) \\times \\vec{s}(t).\\] Derivative of a Scalar Product If \\(f(t)\\) is a scalar-valued function, then \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( f(t)\\vec{r}(t) \\right) = f(t)\\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{r}(t) + \\left(\\frac{d}{dt} f(t)\\right) \\vec{r}(t).\\] 2.5.8 Motion of a point using two reference systems (raw) Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while Rotation of the B reference relative to the A reference must be considered when observing motion with respect to the A reference system. Note: Unit vectors are along the B system axes. Subscripts denote reference system. Reference B can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft. \\[\\bar{\\rho} = x \\hat{i} + y \\hat{j} + z \\hat{k}\\] \\[\\left( \\frac{d \\bar{\\rho}}{dt} \\right)_B = \\dot{x} \\hat{i} + \\dot{y} \\hat{j} + \\dot{z} \\hat{k}\\] \\[\\left( \\frac{d \\bar{\\rho}}{dt} \\right)_A = \\left( \\dot{x}\\hat{i} + \\dot{y}\\hat{j} + \\dot{z}\\hat{k} \\right) + \\left( x \\dot{\\hat{i}} + y \\dot{\\hat{j}} + z \\dot{\\hat{k}} \\right)\\] \\[\\left( \\frac{d \\bar{\\rho}}{dt} \\right)_A = \\left( \\frac{d \\bar{\\rho}}{dt} \\right)_B + \\bar{\\omega} \\times \\bar{\\rho}\\] The velocities of the particle \\(P\\) relative to the \\(A\\) and to the \\(B\\) references, respectively, are as follows: \\[\\bar{V}_A = \\left( \\frac{d\\bar{r}}{dt} \\right)_A\\] \\[\\bar{V}_B = \\left( \\frac{d\\bar{\\rho}}{dt} \\right)_B\\] These velocities can be related by noting that \\(\\bar{r} = \\bar{R} + \\bar{\\rho}\\). Taking the derivative with respect to time for the \\(A\\) reference: \\[\\left(\\frac{d \\bar{r}}{dt} \\right)_A = \\left( \\frac{d \\bar{R}}{dt} \\right)_A + \\left( \\frac{d \\bar{\\rho}}{dt} \\right)_A\\] The term is the “transport velocity” and is the only velocity if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. where is the centripetal acceleration, is the Coriolis acceleration, and is the transport acceleration and is the only acceleration if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. To get acceleration with respect to A, differentiate: where is the centripetal acceleration, is the Coriolis acceleration, and is the transport acceleration and is the only acceleration if point P is rigidly attached to reference B. 2.5.9 Motion of a point using one reference system (raw) Reference A can be considered the inertial frame while The body can be equivalent to a maneuvering aircraft. 2.6 Probability and Statistics (reference 2.6) Definitions: Population: The set of all possible observations Sample: Any subset of a population Homogeneous Sample: The sample comes from 1 population only Random Sample: Equal probability of selecting any member of the population Independence (of events A and B): P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B) Sample and Population Mean (Average value): \\[\\mu = \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{x_i} \\] Mode (Most commonly occurring value in a sample) Median (middle value, 50th percentile. Half of the sample values are greater and half are smaller) Deviation: \\[d_i = x_i - \\bar{x} \\] Population Variance: \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\bar{x}})^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{d_i^2}\\] Population Standard Deviation (square root of variance): \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\bar{x}})^2} \\] Sample Standard Deviation: \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \\bar{x}})^2} \\] Discrete Probability Distributions: Uniform The probability of any outcome in a given set is the same. If there are \\(N\\) possible outcomes in a set, then the probability of a given outcome is \\(p=1/N\\). For example, when rolling a fair dice with \\(N=6\\) sides, the probability that the toss will result in any given side is \\(p = 1/6\\). Binomial The probability that the random variable \\(X = x\\) in \\(N\\) independent events, each having probability \\(p\\) of success, and \\(1-p\\) of failure. \\[P(X = k) = \\binom{N}{k}p^x (1-p)^{N-x}\\] where \\[\\binom{N}{k} = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}\\]. For example, tossing a fair coin N times where \\(p = 1/2\\) is the probability of getting a head on any toss. If \\(X\\) indicates the number of heads in \\(N\\) tosses, then we have \\(P(X = x) = (1/2)^x (1/2)^{N-x}\\). For \\(N = 4\\) we have the following table: |x |P(X=x)| |:-|:-| |\\(0\\)| \\(1/16\\)| |\\(1\\)| \\(1/4\\)| |\\(3\\)| \\(3/8\\)| |\\(3\\)| \\(1/4\\)| |\\(4\\)| \\(1/16\\)| Continuous Distributions Continuous distributions are defined for all \\(x \\in [a,b]\\), where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) or for all \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\), that is, the whole real number line. The probability for any single point is zero; that is, \\(P(X=x) = 0\\). Instead, one must work with probability on an interval, e.g., \\(P(0 &lt; x)\\) or \\(P(a &lt; x &lt; b)\\). The Normal Distribution The probability density function of the Normal Distribution is given by: \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma}}e^{\\frac{-(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\]. The Standard Normal Distribution The Standard Normal Distribution is simply the Normal Distribution with \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma=1\\). Error Probable An interval centered at the mean that contains one-half of the distribution. Circular Error Probable A circle centered at the mean, in a bivariate normal distribution, that contains one-half of the distribution. Confidence Intervals An interval estimate of a statistic. Central Limit Theorem The sample mean of data sampled from a normally distributed population is itself normally distributed with mean, \\(\\mu\\), and variance, \\(\\sigma^2/\\sqrt{n}\\), where the population distribution is \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(n\\) is the sample size and usually \\(n \\geq 30\\). Hypothesis Testing Begins with an assumption (hypothesis), usually about the underlying population distribution of some measured quantity or computed error. Select values for the hypothesis and alternate hypothesis(es) that partition the sample space. Collect N samples of the population test statistic or parameter. There are two types of errors: Type 1 errors reject the hypothesis when it is true; Type II accept the hypothesis when in is false. 2.7 Standard Series (raw) (reference 2.4) Taylor’s Maclaurin’s (Taylor series with a = 0 ): Binomial: Exponential: Logarithmic: Trigonometric: 2.8 Derivative Table (raw) (references 2.2, 2.3) \\[*x* is the independent variable; *u* and *v* are dependent on *x; w* is dependent on *u; a* and *n* are constants; *log* is common logarithm; *ln* is logarithm to the base *e*\\] 2.9 Integral Table (raw) (references 2.2, 2.3) x is any variable, u is any function of x, a &amp; b are arbitrary constants.

The centrifugal relief correction is where ω is the earth’s rotation rate and Rx is the perpendicular distance from the earth's axis to the surface and can be calculated as Rx =R cos φ (see figure below). For any centrifugal relief calculations associated with aircraft performance, it is sufficiently exact (g ±0.00004 m/s2) to use the average earth radius. An aircraft flying eastward contributes to centrifugal relief while a westbound aircraft diminishes it. The International Association of Geodesy publishes the following equation (accurate to 0.005%) to calculate local sea level gravity including the effects of centrifugal relief for any point fixed to the earth's surface The above equation is tabulated below for quick reference.

Gravity Influence on Aircraft Cruise Performance Even at the same altitude, changes in gravity due to latitude or centrifugal relief directly alter the required lift, drag, and fuel flow. For example, with sufficiently precise instrumentation, data collected heading West could show about 0.5% more drag and fuel flow than data collected heading East (centrifugal relief effect). After determining test and standard (or mission) values for g, flight test values for CL, CD, drag, and fuel flow can be corrected to standard as follows: where Nz = normal load factor, CL = lift coefficient, CD = drag coefficient, AR = aspect ratio, e = Oswald efficiency factor, ∆D change in drag force, TSFC = thrust specific fuel consumption, and = standard day fuel flow Section 3.3 General Properties of Air (reference 3.9.1) Gas constant, R = 53.35 ft lb/R lbm = 287.074 J/kg K = 1716 lb(ft)/slgs(R) = 3089.7 lb(ft)/slgs(K) Speed of sound = ao(θ) ½ = 49.02 (TR)1/2 ft/sec = 33.42 (TR)1/2 miles/hr = 29.04 (TR)1/2 knots = 20.05 (TR)1/2 m/sec Density, ρ = .0023769 slug/ft3 = 1.225 kg/m3 (at 15o C) Specific weight, gρ = .07647 sec2/ft4 Specific heat capacity at 59oF (=To) at constant pressure, cp = .240 BTU/lb R = 1004.76 J/kg K at constant volume, cv = .1715 BTU/lb R = 717.986 J/kg K specific heat ratio, γ = {cp / cv } =1.4 Normal Composition of clean, dry atmospheric air near sea level Nitrogen, N2 78.084 % by volume Oxygen, O2 20.948 % Argon, A 0.934 % Carbon Dioxide, CO2 0.031 % Neon, Ne 0.002 % total 99.9988 % plus traces of helium, kryton, xenon, hydrogen, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and iodine.

A standard atmosphere provides a common basis to relate all flight test, wind tunnel results, aircraft design and general performance. Several models of “standard atmosphere” exist with minor differences based on mathematical constants used in the calculations. Geometric altitude, hG , is defined as the height of an aircraft above sea level (also called tapeline altitude) Absolute altitude, ha, is defined as the height of an aircraft above the center of the earth: (geometric altitude + radius of the earth). Geopotential altitude, h, is required because g changes with height.If potential energy is calculated using sea level weight (WSL = mgo) instead of actual weight (W = mg), then the altitude must be lower. W hG = WSL h * * Pressure altitude, Hp is the altitude, on a standard day, at which the test day pressure would be found Density altitude is the altitude, on a standard day, at which the test day density would be found Temperature altitude is the altitude, on a standard day, at which the test day temperature would be found Assumptions on which the standard atmosphere is built 1.

Earth Modeling The Geodetic System defines the location of any point relative to the earth using latitude, longitude and height (Figure 3.8-1, point P). Longitude and latitude are expressed in degrees, minutes, seconds. Longitude lines extend \\(\\pm\\) 180 degrees from the Prime Meridian, run north to south, and converge at the poles. Latitude lines are parallel to the equator and extend \\(\\pm\\) 90°. http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/coordsys/gif/latlon2.gif Figure 3.8-1 Geodetic Coordinate System The 1984 world geodetic system, WGS84, models the earth’s surface as an oblate spheroid - an ellipsoid rotated about its semi-minor axis. In this model, used by global positioning systems, the earth’s semi-major axis, a is 6,378,137.0 meters and the semi-minor axis, b is 6,356,752.314 meters. The flatness factor (f) is defined as: \\[f = \\frac{a - b}{a}\\] For the WGS84 model, f =1/298.257223563 Because the earth is not perfectly spherical, there are various methods for defining latitude. Unlike the geocentric latitude which uses the earth’s center for determining a point’s latitude, the geodetic latitude (used herein) is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line normal to the reference ellipsoid. Figure 3.8-1 exaggerates this with a normal line being well offset from the earth’s center. This definition leads to a degree of latitude being longer at the pole than at the equator: 111,694 m (60.3 nm) vs. 110,574 m (59.7 nm). The geodetic longitude of a point is the angle between a reference plane and a plane passing through the point, both planes being perpendicular to the equatorial plane. Mathematically, the geodetic surface is a smooth ellipsoid modeling the earth’s surface. Clearly, the topography (actual surface height) deviates from this model whenever land is above or below sea level. Less evident is that the actual sea level also deviates from the geodetic model due to local changes in the earth’s gravity. Specifically, mass variations caused by changes in earth density and topography, such as mountains or trenches, change local gravity vectors and therefore sea level relative to the ellipsoid. Reference to Mean Sea Level (MSL) served as the traditional way to express topographic or bathymetric height. Geodesists once considered the sea in balance with the earth's gravity and formed a perfectly regular figure. MSL is usually described as a tidal datum that is the arithmetic mean of hourly water elevations observed over a 19-year (Metonic) cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows caused by the changing effects of the gravitational forces from the moon and sun. MSL defines the zero elevation (vertical datum) for a local area. Because the sea surface conforms to the earth's gravitational field, MSL also has slight hills and valleys similar to the land surface but much smoother. Zero elevation as defined by one nation is often not the same zero elevation defined by another, thus locally defined vertical datums differ from each other. The Geoid is the equipotential surface in the earth’s gravity field that coincides most closely with the mean sea level extended continuously under the continents. In other words, it approximates the level of any non-flowing water connected (actually or theoretically) to the seas by waterway or via trenches or tunnels. The geoid surface undulates relative to the geodetic ellipsoid and is perpendicular to the local gravity vector – as seen with a plumb line. Similarly, a spirit level defines the local surface parallel to the geoid, which is tangent to the local horizon. Because the geoid is an equipotential surface, it is the best datum for measuring potential energy and is the true zero surface for measuring elevations. Previously, there was no way to accurately measure the geoid, so heights were measured relative to the similar MSL. EGM96 (Earth Gravity Model 1996) represents the best geoid model currently available and shows smoothly changing surface undulations ranging from +85 to -107 meters relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid. The geoid surface cannot be directly observed, thus heights above or below it can't be directly measured. Instead the geoid surface is modeled mathematically using gravitational measurements. Although for practical purposes, at the coastline the geoid and MSL surfaces are assumed to be essentially the same, at some spots the geoid can actually differ from MSL by several meters. http://principles.ou.edu/earth\\_figure\\_gravity/geoid/geoid-ellipsoidal-orthometric\\_height.jpg Figure 3.8-2 Height Comparisons Ellipsoidal height (h) is the same as geodetic height and is the geometric distance between an object and the earth ellipsoid (Figure 3.8-2). This may be a GPS output. Geoid height (N) is the height of the geoid above or below the ellipsoid. Some GPS devices output this undulation value in the data stream. Orthometric height (H) is the geometric distance along a gravitational force line from a given point P to the geoid. This is essentially the conventional height measurement because the geoid approximates MSL- the traditional method for determining height. Modern GPS units typically include a geoid model (e.g. EGM-96) that provides N (geoid height over the WGS ellipsoid) at the current position. Such a unit can provide the height above geoid. If GPS height output is only available relative to the ellipsoid (h), then traditional Orthometric height (H) above the geoid can be obtained by subtracting the geoid height above the ellipsoid. \\[http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0703/geoid1of3.html\\] ECEF Transformations For the purpose of performance, navigation, or noise analysis, flight testers may require distances between two points (the shortest being along the great circle arc) and the average heading of that arc. Calculating these from typical Geodetic System Lat/Long inputs requires conversion to the Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system as shown in Figure 3.8-3. Figure 3.8-3 Earth Centered Earth Fixed Coordinate System The ECEF coordinate system is a Cartesian system with the origin at the earth’s center. In this system, the X-axis is defined by the intersection of the Prime Meridian and equatorial planes. The Z-axis goes through the North Pole. The Y-axis completes a right-handed orthogonal system by a plane 90 degrees east of the X-axis and its intersection with the equator. Geodetic System (lat/long/height) data converts to ECEF as follows: x = (N + h)\\(\\bullet\\)cos(φ)\\(\\bullet\\)cos(λ) y = (N + h)\\(\\bullet\\)cos(φ)\\(\\bullet\\)sin(λ) z = (N\\(\\bullet\\)(1-e2) + h) \\(\\bullet\\)sin(φ) where, x = ECEF coordinate parallel to the X-axis y = ECEF coordinate parallel to the Y-axis z = ECEF coordinate parallel to the Z-axis φ = geodetic latitude λ = geodetic longitude h = height above geodetic (ellipsoid) surface N = Normal radius of curvature; distance from earth axis to any point on the geodetic surface at that latitude (extension of r to axis shown in Figure 3.8-3). \\[N = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1 - e^{2} \\bullet \\sin^{2}(\\phi)}}\\] where, a = semi-major axis radius (6,378,137 m; 20,925,647 ft) e2 = eccentricity squared; \\(e^{2} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right)^{2} = 2 \\bullet f - f^{2}\\)= 0.00669438002290 (Earth, per WGS84). Also useful is M = Meridian radius of curvature; distance from earth axis to any point on the geodetic surface at that longitude. \\[M = \\frac{a(1 - e^{2})}{\\left\\lbrack 1 - e^{2} \\bullet \\sin^{2}(\\phi) \\right\\rbrack^{1.5}}\\] Great Circle Calculations Any plane passing through the center of a spheroid traces a Great Circle around the perimeter of that spheroid. The shortest distance between two points on the surface is that portion of the great circle arc encompassing both points (Figure 3.8-3). Figure 3.8-3 Great Circle Arc Except when moving around the equator, navigating along a great circle route has the characteristic of intercepting longitude lines at different angles. In other words, the heading (or bearing) changes along the route. Analysis shows bearing change along a great circle route: Is never greater than the longitude difference between the end points. Approaches the value of the longitude change as the final latitude approaches a pole (regardless of initial latitude). Is smallest when the final latitude is at the equator (for this case, bearing change ≈ longitude change x initial latitude/100). Calculate the great circle distance (D) between points (subscripts 1 and 2) as \\(P_{1} = \\sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} + z_{1}^{2}}\\), \\(\\text{\\ \\ P}_{2} = \\sqrt{x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} + z_{2}^{2}}\\) \\[{\\overset{\\rightarrow}{P}}_{1} \\bullet {\\overset{\\rightarrow}{P}}_{2} = P_{1} \\bullet P_{2}\\cos\\varphi = x_{1} \\bullet x_{2} + y_{1} \\bullet y_{2} + z_{1} \\bullet z_{2}\\] \\[\\varphi = \\arccos\\left( \\frac{x_{1} \\bullet x_{2} + y_{1} \\bullet y_{2} + z_{1} \\bullet \\text{Zz}_{2}}{P_{1} \\bullet P_{2}} \\right)\\] \\[D = P_{\\text{avg}} \\bullet \\varphi\\] where P = distance from earth center to any point (including height above the spheroid surface). \\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{P}\\) = Vector from the Earth’s center to point P. ϕ = Angle between the two \\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{P}\\) vectors &lt;http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html&gt; provides equations an online tool for calculating great circle initial &amp; final bearings (headings). Local Distance Transformation Latitude φ, longitude λ, and height (typical GPS output data) can be transformed into rectangular (X,Y,Z) coordinates. The following presents a method for applying this to two different coordinate systems, both with the X-Y axes defining the horizontal plane. This is useful when working with local distances associated with typical flight testing such as noise measurement, local navigation, or field performance. Figure 3.8-4a shows a case where the X-Y coordinate system aligns with the latitude &amp; longitude grid. Figure 3.8-4b shows a case where the X-Y coordinate system aligns with a runway, with Y=0 defining the centerline. In both cases, a designated primary reference datum \\[*φ*~0~, λ~0~\\], such as the runway centerline threshold, coincides with X=0, Y=0. With the example shown in Figure 3.8-4b, the opposite end of the runway centerline \\[*φ*~1~, λ~1~\\], coincides with X= runway length and Y= 0. Figure 3.8-4: Local X-Y Coordinate System Aligned with (a)φ,λ Grid; (b) Runway Because each degree of latitude change is not always exactly 60 nm and because the spacing between degrees of longitude changes markedly with latitude, converting from degrees latitude &amp; longitude change to distance requires scaling factors. First select equatorial distances for each degree change φ_scale{φ=0} = 110,574 m = 362,776.6 ft = 59.70518 nm λ_scale{φ=0} = 111,319.5 m = 365,221.4 ft = 60.10772 nm Use average latitude to calculate latitude and longitude scaling factors \\(\\varnothing\\_\\text{scale} = \\frac{\\varnothing\\_\\mathrm{\\text{scale}}\\{\\varnothing = 0\\}}{\\left\\lbrack 1 - e^{2} \\bullet \\sin^{2}(\\phi) \\right\\rbrack^{1.5}}\\) \\(\\mathrm{\\lambda}\\_\\mathrm{\\text{scale}} = \\frac{\\lbrack\\lambda\\_\\text{scale}\\{\\varnothing = 0\\}\\rbrack \\bullet cos\\varnothing}{\\sqrt{1 - e^{2} \\bullet \\sin^{2}(\\phi)}}\\) Calculate X and Y components of distances aligned with the latitude &amp; longitude grid (Figure 3.8-4a) Y = φ _scale·(φ 1 - φ 0) X = λ_scale·(λ1 - λ0) The 2-D local (vice great circle) distance between any two points on the X-Y plane is D = (X2 + Y2)1/2 For field performance work, it is preferable to align X &amp; Y with the runway as shown in Figure 3.8-4b. To convert from grid-aligned to runway-aligned coordinates, apply a rotation matrix that ensures X remains positive when going from point \\[*φ* ~0~, λ~0~\\] towards \\[*φ* ~1~, λ~1~\\]. The rotation angle, ψ, is positive counter-clockwise from true East to the direction of the runway. \\[Note: do not confuse *ψ* with runway heading measured relative to magnetic north\\]. The function ψ = atan2(X, Y) returns rotation angles from - π to π, so that rotating to headings between 90° and 270° results in negative rotation angles. For any point \\[*φ*, λ\\], calculate runway-aligned X &amp; Y distances using X = φ _scale·( φ - φ 0)·sin(ψ) + λ_scale·(λ - λ0)·cos(ψ) Y = φ _scale·( φ - φ 0)·cos(ψ) – λ_scale·(λ - λ0)·sin(ψ) This provides a right-handed rectangular coordinate system where X is positive from \\[*φ* ~0~, λ~0~\\] towards \\[*φ*~1~, λ~1~\\] and Y is positive left of the runway centerline (Figure 3.8-4b). Calculating aircraft height Z above the X-Y plane requires defining where the X-Y plane lies. An analyst may define Z=0 at some arbitrary height (i.e. GPS altitude at the beginning of a maneuver) and consider only changes from that reference. For field performance, it is typical to use the runway altitude as the reference. Because runway altitudes vary however, height should be surveyed and modeled or tabulated as a function runway centerline position, H{X}. For best accuracy, the runway survey accounts for GPS antenna height above the surface. Airplane height above the X-Y plane (Z) is then Z = ζ – H{X} where ζ is the test GPS antenna’s altitude. . 3.9 Temperature Compensated Barometric Altitude Background: Pressure altitude is the geopotential height above mean sea level (MSL) associated with atmospheric pressure on a theoretical standard day. Geopotential height is almost identical to geometric (a.k.a. tapeline) altitude, as seen in page 03-5. Altimeters set at 29.92 in Hg (or 1013 HPa) display pressure altitude. An altimeter’s baro-set knob allows pilots to bias the pressure vs. altitude relation so it matches sea level pressure for non-standard conditions. Matching the local altimeter setting (known as setting QNH in many parts of the world) adjusts the altimeter so it displays nearly the same altitude above MSL for non-standard pressure conditions. The correct setting is critical for terrain &amp; obstacle clearance when the pilot’s visibility is low. Although the long-used practice of matching the local altimeter setting has been sufficiently safe in the vast majority of operations, it in fact does not account for temperature deviation from standard conditions. Extreme temperature deviations cause a classic mechanical altimeter to display an MSL altitude erring by hundreds of feet. Modern technology allows calculating and displaying a more accurate altitude that corrects for temperature deviations. The following equation yields temperature-compensated altitude which better estimates geometric altitude above MSL, hG. Calculations require knowledge of aircraft’s baro and pressure altitudes and the terminal airport’s temperature and pressure altitude. In lieu of pressure altitudes, calculations allow for implementing the field elevation (depicted on airport approach plates, etc.) and so-called baro bias. Baro bias is the displayed altitude shift when switching from local to standard altimeter setting. hG = Hb + \\[(*T~ap~*~t~ -- *T~0~*)/*L* -- *Hp~apt~*\\]ln\\[1 + *L*(*Hp* -- *Hp~apt~*)/(*T~0~* + *L\\*Hp~apt~*)\\] where hG = temperature-compensated altitude Hb = baro altitude (displayed when altimeter is set to local value) Tapt = airport temperature (Kelvin) T0 = standard day sea level temperature = 15 deg C = 288.15 K L = standard temperature lapse rate = -0.0065 K/m = -.0019812 K/ft Hpapt = airport pressure altitude ( = airport field elevation – baro bias) Hp = aircraft pressure altitude ( = Hb – baro bias) Note: ensure altitude units are consistent with lapse rate units. In lieu of the pilot adjusting the baro set knob to determine baro bias, it may be calculated using Baro bias = Hb - Hp = Hb – (29.92.1903 – PA.1903)/.00001313 \\[ft\\] where PA = ambient pressure = {altimeter setting \\[in Hg\\].1903 – Hb(.00001313)}1/.1903 Flight testers can use the above to verify the aircraft’s temperature compensation system is working correctly. Data analysts can use these equations to more precisely determine geometric height above the ground–potentially useful for performance or pitot-static flyby testing.

Above sea level, the calibrated airspeed must be re-scaled for pressure effects on compressibility. The mathematical method for determining Ve from Vc is to first solve the calibrated airspeed equation for qc ~~ ~~ ~~ Next, substitute this value and the ambient pressure (Pa) into the equivalent airspeed equation. (qc = PT - Pa ) The adjacent chart does this graphically for all subsonic airspeeds.

Modern methods replace the tower system with a radar altimeter or GPS unit to determine tapeline height above the flyby line (Hg).

Accurately converting this static source error to an airspeed correction also requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (∆PT ). This can be determined either through direct comparison with a calibrated noseboom pitot pressure or from one of the airspeed-based methods that directly yield airspeed corrections (pace, ground course, GPS). In lieu of these options, the pitot error may assumed to be zero, but this will reduce confidence in the calculated value for airspeed correction. 4.7.2 Ground Course Method This airspeed-based Test method determines airspeed corrections directly. Accurately converting this airspeed error to a static source error requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (∆PT ). This can be determined using one of the altitude-based methods that directly yield altitude corrections (tower fly-by, trailing cone or bomb).

Accurately converting this static source error to an airspeed correction also requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (∆PT ).

You must determine wind speed and direction to calculate VT and T0 and to ensure steady winds existed during test series. GPS accuracies are variable. Know tolerances before accepting GPS as a truth model.

Accurately converting this airspeed error to a static source error requires knowledge of the test pitot tube's total pressure error (∆PT ). This can be determined using one of the altitude-based methods that directly yield altitude corrections (tower fly-by, trailing cone or bomb). In lieu of these options, the pitot error may assumed to be zero, but this will reduce confidence in the calculated values for static pressure error and altimeter. correction Graphs in Section 4.11 separately show the effect of measurement errors in ∆PT, air temperature, or true airspeed on ∆VC calculations . The last chart (Page 04-29) shows how each knot of accumulated ∆VC uncertainty affects the ∆HC uncertainty at various altitudes and temperatures. Flying four legs instead of three allows four separate calculations of wind speed &amp; direction to confirm stable winds at that test airspeed. If several real-time calculations of winds confirm constant direction and velocity, then testing may be shortened by flying only one pass directly into or away from the wind. If this is done, an end-of-test wind calibration must be performed to confirm steady winds throughout the test series. To minimize temperature and wind variations, testing should be accomplished within a relatively small area. Horseshoe Track GPS Method Horseshoe Heading GPS Method •Horseshoe Heading Method ∼Fly three legs with perpendicular headings, noting GPS ground speed on each ∼Determine true airspeed by solving three equations in three unknowns The “Windbox” method consists of flying four legs instead of three. The extra leg provides a fourfold increase in wind calculations to improve result confidence. The “Orbis” method extends this advantage by collecting data at every heading throughout a level turn. Cloverleaf Method (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet adapted from Doug Gray, NSW Australia) Fly three legs with approximately 90-120 degree difference between headings. ~ Can be accomplished in a broad turn as with the horseshoe method, or ~ Directly over a single point (cloverleaf maneuver).

The Z-axis point towards the center of the Earth. • The origin of a fixed-Earth system does not move relative to the Earth. (such as a ground radar site) • The origin of a moving Earth system does not move relative to its host (such as an aircraft inertial reference unit) . 6.2 Aircraft Axis Systems (ref 6.6.2) • The body axis system originates at the aircraft’s reference center of gravity. The +xb direction is towards the front, the +yb direction is towards the right wing tip, and the +zb direction is towards the bottom of the aircraft. • The stability axis system is similar to the body axis system except that it is rotated about the y-axis through the angle of attack (α) Forces, velocities or accelerations along the stability axes are related to the body axes as follows xb = xs cos α − zs sin α zb = zs cos α + xs sin α yb = ys For cases where the z axis is defined positive upward (typical for normal-axis accelerometers) xb = xs cos α + zs sin α zb = zs cos α - xs sin α • The wind axis system is similar to the stability axis system except it is rotated about the zs axis through the angle of sideslip (β). The term “wind” refers to the fact that the freestream relative wind approaches the aircraft directly along the xw axis. This dictates that the true airspeed also lies along the xw axis. Forces, velocities or accelerations along the wind axes are related to the stability axes as follows xs = xw cos β − yw sin β ys = yw cos β + xw sin β zs = zw The geometric relations between body, stability and wind axis velocities are illustrated here. Most aircraft sideslip vanes do not measure β directly. They measure the flanking angle, which is the projection of the relative wind into the aircraft’s x-y plane. The difference between these two angles increases with angle of attack. Ignoring upwash, boom bending, and body axis rate corrections, calculate true sideslip as a function of vane α and β as follows: βtrue = tan-1 \\[ tan(β~vane~ ) cosα \\] • Wind-Body Axis Transformations (ref 6.6.1) Combining the two previous transformations, forces, velocities or accelerations along the wind axes are related to the body axes as follows After expansion, xb = cosα (xwcosβ – ywsinβ) - zwsinα yb = xwsinβ + ywcosβ zb = sinα (xwcosβ – ywcosβ) + zwcosα The inverse transform, converting from the body to the wind axis system is After expansion, xw = cosβ (xbcosα + zbsinα) + ybsinβ yw = -sinβ (xbcosα+zbsinα)+ ybcosβ zw = -xbsinα + zbcosα Note that these equations apply to the sign convention with z+ down. If sign convention (and instrumentation calibration) use z+ upward, then the above equations become: xw = cosβ(xbcosα - zbsinα) + ybsinβ yw = –sinβ(xbcosα + zbsinα) + ybcosβ zw = xbsinα + zbcosα • The Principle axes are those about which the products of inertia are zero. They can be equated to the axis of “dumbells” which represent concentrated mass elements. Neglecting aerodynamic and gyroscopic effects, an aircraft rotating about one of its principle axes will not tend to cross-couple into motion about any other axis. Wind to Body Axes Matrix Transformation 6.3 Euler Angles (ref 6.6.1) Euler angles are expressed as yaw, pitch, and roll. The sequence: first yaw, then pitch, then roll; must be maintained to arrive at the proper orientation angles. The Euler angles are defined as follows: ψ ≡ Yaw Angle: The angle between the projection of the vehicle xb- axis onto the horizontal reference plane and some initial reference position of the Earth x-axis. Yaw angle equals the vehicle heading only if the initial reference is North. θ ≡ Pitch angle (in vertical plane) between xb and horizon. φ ≡ Bank angle, the angle (measured in the y-z plane of the body-axis system) between the y-axis and the horizontal reference plane. Also known at the roll angle, it is a measure of the rotation (about the x-axis) to return the aircraft to a wings level condition. 6.4 Flight Path Angles (ref 6.6.3) Just as the Euler angles define the attitude of the aircraft with respect to the Earth, three flightpath angles describe the vehicle's cg trajectory relative to the Earth (not the air mass). σ = Flight path heading angle; also known as ground track heading, is the horizontal angle between some reference direction (usually North) and the projection of the velocity vector on the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is from North to East. γ = Flightpath elevation angle; the vertical angle between the flightpath and the horizontal plane. Positive rotation is up. During a descent, this parameter is commonly known as glide path angle. μ = Flightpath bank angle; the angle between the plane formed by the velocity vector and the lift vector and the vertical plane containing the velocity vector. Positive rotation is clockwise about the velocity vector, looking forward. The first two parameters above are easily measured using ground-based radar, or onboard GPS or inertial reference systems. If only α, β, and the Euler angles are available, then assuming zero winds, the flightpath angles can be calculated as Technically, the above equations describe the velocity vector (angles relative to the air mass). If the air mass is moving relative to the Earth, as is usually the case, the above equations do not describe the flight path. Editor’s note: not knowing the difference between flightpath and velocity vector angles can cause considerable confusion when analyzing data from different sources. 6.5 Axis System Transformations (ref 6.6.2) Transformation matrix for converting forces, velocities or accelerations from inertial (X, Y, Z) to body (x, y, z) axes Expanding gives: The inverse of the above transform matrix converts from the body axis to the inertial axis coordinate system Acceleration Transformations • Convert body-axis angular rates &amp; linear accelerations into total accelerations along body axes. • Convert element (m1) location &amp; rates into specific angular momentum Transformations between body axis rates and Euler angle rates Transformations from Euler &amp; aerodynamic angles to the aircraft stability and wind axis angular rates.
