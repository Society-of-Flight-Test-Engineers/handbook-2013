thanks,
I had no problem the last time you emailed the entire document.

   1. Yes, the equations definitely must be fixed - that's a show-stopper.
   2. My bad, the conversion to Pascal should be 6894.75728.
   3. The top of the new section 3.8 has a couple references. Please copy
   or move these to section 3.9.
   4. The rear cover index I see has orange  borders. I really hoped oragne
   would work but the BoD sent me a sample cover page printed on orange paper
   and it looked like hell after sittin gon my desk for a month. It faded and
   looked cheap, so got agreement from the BoD to forget about orange unless
   we find a good deal on orange binders.
   5. add the std atmosphere calculator website address <
   http://www.digitaldutch.com/atmoscalc/> to the ref handbook. I suggest
   doing in in two places: first after the table on pg 3-17. there's plenty of
   space there.  Secondly, add it to the reference section in 3.9
   6. please add the following unit conversion website address to the top
   of pg 01-01 or bottom of 01-12 <http://www.onlineconversion.com/>, and
   again on the reference page 01-47.
